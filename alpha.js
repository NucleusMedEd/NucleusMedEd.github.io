The fatigue is worsened by activity and symptoms worsen after exercise or at the end of the day. This fluctuation in weakness can help differentiate MG from other neuromuscular disorders. The disease can attack any muscle group although the ocular, bulbar and facial muscles are more likely affected. Approximately 50 percent of patients present with ocular symptoms. Proximal limbs are affected more than distal in MG. Physical examination may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Ocular complaints include ptosis, diplopia, and internuclear opthalmoplegia or vertical gaze paresis with pupil sparing. The ptosis may increase with sustained upward gaze or by holding up the opposite eyelid. Patients with bulbar symptoms are fatigable chewing, dysarthria and dysphagia or nasal speech. Facial muscle fatigue can cause an expressionless appearance. Respiratory muscle weakness is the most severe form of MG and can lead to respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is often precipitated by upper respiratory infection. Patients with MG often present with transient symptoms that eventually become more persistent and worsen over years.", "initial test? An acetylcholine receptor antibody test is a quick, easy, non-invasive, and cost-effective study to aid in the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG).  It is the most appropriate first step in determining whether a patient indeed has MG or not. Repetitive nerve stimulation to an affected muscle shows increasing decrement in amplitude of compound muscle action potential. This progressive decline in amplitude is seen with the first few stimuli to the muscle. A normal muscle will show no change in amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation.", "Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors are the treatment of choice in patients with Myasthenia Gravis (MG). Pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and edrophonium are common agents. Pyridostigmine is the agent of choice used for maintenance therapy.

He also reports that he has no problem when he begins to eat his meal but does have difficulty finishing a meal in the same sitting due to chewing fatigue, especially when eating meats.

Bilateral ataxia is witnessed but it can be asymmetric and more severe on the weaker side. Weakness of the bulbar muscles, such as facial weakness, dysphonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and limited jaw movements, are common. Weakness is seen on the side of the face and contralateral side of the body. Bulbar weakness is bilateral.

Findings of a lower motor neuron lesion include muscle weakness with atrophy and fasiculations. Symptoms of extremity involvement include tripping, stumbling or foot drop. Classic history includes a 'slapping gait'. Wrist drop and cramping of muscles in the hands are reported. Patients may complain of difficulty buttoning a shirt or turning a key. Only a quarter of patients have bulbar weakness characterized by slurred speech and/or hoarseness, choking while eating and difficulty drinking liquids. Emotional and cognitive difficulties, such as depression, emotional liability, and impaired social behavior, can also manifest in ALS. Serious complications of respiratory insufficiency and aspiration pneumonia develop as the disease progresses. Patients eventually become bedridden.

Typically, patients report symptoms with gait or difficulty getting out of bed, chairs and/or climbing stairs. Muscle atrophy is not apparent and muscle weakness improves with activity. Autonomic dysfunction is unique to Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome. Oropharyngeal symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia and difficulty chewing are less common but can be present in Lambert-Eaton.

Gray matter, axons and the peripheral nervous systemic are spared. Women are more commonly affected and they typically present in their third or fourth decades. Symptoms can be monofocal or multifocal and most patients report a history of asymptomatic periods in between exacerbations. Clinical features include decreased sensory, muscle weakness with spasticity, and loss of bladder and bowel control.

However, it can be stored in the liver for up to one year and a deficiency does not always manifest itself for one year or more. Vitamin B12 deficiency is most often due to inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption associated with pernicious anemia and other gastric abnormalities such as Crohn's disease or Celiac disease. Vegans and vegetarians are particularly susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, medications such as oral contraceptive pills and proton pump inhibitors can reduce absorption of the vitamin. The onset of pernicious anemia is insidious and vague. Typically, medical attention is sought once symptoms of organ involvement manifest. Pernicious anemia can present with the classic triad of weakness, sore tongue and paresthesias but are usually not the chief symptom complex. As the disease progresses, defects in the peripheral nervous system become apparent. These include impaired vibration sense, ataxia and paresthesias due to posterior spinal cord demyelination. Cardiovascular complications include heart failure. Patients with a hematocrit < 20% typically have an increase in cardiac output which can produce a systolic flow murmur.

If FEP is elevated, then additional hematological analysis should be performed. This analysis includes a complete blood count with peripheral smear and kidney function tests. The clinical monitoring test for diagnosing lead toxicity is the blood lead level. The blood lead level is a good indication of lead exposure over a few weeks span.
