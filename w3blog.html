  <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and is the most common cause of dementia. Approximately 50 percent of patients with dementia have AD. Prevalence increases with age; autopsy studies have shown that AD changes can be seen in most individuals as they age. AD is a chronic disease with latent and prodromal stages. Memory loss is the presenting symptom. Visuospatial disturbances, poor concentration and impaired judgment are also observed. AD is a clinical diagnosis. Progressive atrophy, gliosis and diffuse cortical atrophy with enlargement of the ventricles can be seen on neuroimaging. Histopathology shows senile plaques which are characterized by eosinophilia and amyloid A beta deposition. The hippocampus is primarily affected. Neurofibrillary tangles which are intraneuronal aggregates of abnormally modified microtubule associated tau proteins are also characteristic.</p>

<div id="DemoB" class="w3-container w3-hide">Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide cysteine-adenosine-guanine repeat expansion on chromosome 4. The disease is characterized by choreiform movements, behavioral change and dementia. Chorea is the hallmark symptom of HD. Chorea is a rapid, arrhythmic and involuntary movement of the face, trunk, and limbs. Disorders in movement are the first symptoms to appear and develop insidiously with psychiatric and cognitive features. Hypotonia with hyperreflexia is a feature of early disease. As the disease progresses, chorea is replaced by a rigid, parkinsonian state. Abnormal eye movements are seen in early disease. Psychiatric symptoms include irritability, depression and social problems. Cognitive decline is defined as executive dysfunction with diminished ability to make decisions, multitask and difficulty with time. However, different from Alzheimer disease, memory loss is not a typical feature until advanced disease. Lastly, unintentional weight loss and cachexia are common. Diagnosis is clinical and based on a positive family history. Atrophy, neuronal loss with protein aggregates are seen in the caudate and putamen. HD is an incurable disease; treatment is supportive only. <button onclick="document.getElementById('modalQHuntington').style.display='block'" class="w3-button w3-white">&gt;&gt; <b>question</b> &lt;&lt;</button>

However, Lewy body dementia differs from Alzheimer's disease in that memory loss is not the first presenting symptom. Impairments in attention, executive and visuospatial abilities present initially. Mental status is fluctuating. Patients typically have problems with work or driving difficulties. The key component of Lewy body dementia is parkinsonian symptoms that develop later in the disease. Neuroimaging shows atrophy of the brain with sparing of the hippocampus. Accumulation of round, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, called Lewy bodies, in the substantia nigra are seen on pathological examination.

      <h3><b>Iron Deficiency Anemia</b></h3>
      <h5>Hematology, <span class="w3-opacity"><script> document.write(new Date().toLocaleDateString()); </script></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <div><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
 Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. Iron is a vital metal for living organisms. It is used in oxygen transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and electron transport. Iron is absorbed by the proximal small intestine and is delivered to cells via transferrin. The iron concentration within erythrocytes varies directly with the body's daily iron requirement. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by insufficient dietary intake, iron malabsorption, and/or iron loss from bleeding. Chronic blood loss from menstrual bleeding must always be excluded. Clinical features include pallor, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, orthostatic hypotension, and/or tachycardia. If the anemia is untreated, more severe physical signs will be evident. Laboratory analysis in iron deficiency anemia reveals a high red blood cell distribution width with a low mean corpuscular width (MCV). A low MCV reflects the abnormally small size of the red blood cells. This is known as a microcytic anemia.Â  A low serum ferritin and iron with an elevated serum transferrin and a high total iron binding capacity (TIBC) are laboratory values that are seen in iron deficiency anemia. A low serum ferritin is the most sensitive lab test for iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation, the ratio of serum iron to TIBC is the most specific indicator of iron deficiency. Transferrin saturation is low in iron deficiency. The blood smear of a patient with iron deficiency anemia shows many hypochromic, small red blood cells. There is a widening of the central pallor accounting for greater than one-third of the total red blood cell diameter. Poikilocytosis and anisocytosis may also be apparent. </div>
