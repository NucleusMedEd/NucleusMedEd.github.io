  <br>
  <p><span id="myastheniaGravis" style="display: block;">A 61-year-old male with a&nbsp;past medical history of coronary artery disease presents to the emergency&nbsp;department with generalized weakness, fever and difficulty breathing. He&nbsp;reports a recent upper respiratory tract infection that seemed to get&nbsp;progressively worse. Review of symptoms is positive for occasional slurred&nbsp;speech and blurred vision over the past few years that has always been&nbsp;transient.&nbsp; He also reports that he has
no problem when he begins to eat his meal but does have difficulty finishing a&nbsp;meal in the same sitting due to chewing fatigue, especially when eating meats.&nbsp;Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.7C (98.0F), blood pressure of 124/88&nbsp;mmHg, a heart rate of 84/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min.&nbsp; Physical&nbsp;examination is remarkable for eyelid droop with sustained upgaze, weakness of&nbsp;eye adduction, upper extremity muscle strength 3 out of 5, with complete muscle&nbsp;strength in lower extremities. Neurological reflexes are two out of two&nbsp;throughout.&nbsp;He appears to have difficulty holding up his head upright in&nbsp;the neutral position for a prolong amount of time.</span></p>

        <div class="panel-footer">Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. In the disease, antibodies attack the acetylcholine nicotinic postsynaptic receptors in the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles. Patients typically present in second and third decades as well as from sixth to eight decades as well. Symptoms of MG include generalized weakness and muscle fatigue. The fatigue is worsened by activity and symptoms worsen after exercise or at the end of the day. This fluctuation in weakness can help differentiate MG from other neuromuscular disorders. The disease can attack any muscle group although the ocular, bulbar and facial muscles are more likely affected. Approximately 50 percent of patients present with ocular symptoms. Proximal limbs are affected more than distal in MG. Physical examination may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Ocular complaints include ptosis, diplopia, and internuclear opthalmoplegia or vertical gaze paresis with pupil sparing. The ptosis may increase with sustained upward gaze or by holding up the opposite eyelid. Patients with bulbar symptoms are fatigable chewing, dysarthria and dysphagia or nasal speech. Facial muscle fatigue can cause an expressionless appearance. Respiratory muscle weakness is the most severe form of MG and can lead to respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is often precipitated by upper respiratory infection. Patients with MG often present with transient symptoms that eventually become more persistent and worsen over years.</div>

        <div class="panel-footer">Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease caused by antibodies against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In patients with myasthenia gravis, repetitive nerve stimulation to an affected muscle shows increasing decrement in amplitude of compound muscle action potential. This progressive decline in amplitude is seen with the first few stimuli to the muscle. A normal muscle will show no change in amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation.</div>

        <div class="panel-footer">The thymus is involved in the pathogenesis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and is seen in a majority of patients with the disease. The thymus is an organ located in the anterior mediastinum that normal atrophies as a person ages. Acetylcholine receptors are present on the particular cells that make up the thymus. Thymic hyperplasia is common but thymic tumors can occur. These tumors can be noninvasive or invasive. Patients with a thymoma can be asymptomatic. If the size of the tumor is large, superior vena cava syndrome can manifest. Pleural and/or pericardial effusions will present as the disease disseminates. Thymic carcinomas are more aggressive and can cause more symptoms from its invasion into nearby structures. Cough, chest pain, and phrenic nerve paralysis are common symptoms. Thymomas can be seen on CT or MRI. Thymectomy can be curative and provide immediate symptomatic relief.</div>

        <div class="panel-footer">An acetylcholine receptor antibody test is a quick, easy, non-invasive, and cost-effective study to aid in the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG).&nbsp; It is the most appropriate first step in determining whether a patient indeed has MG or not. These antibodies are present in about 85 to 95% of those with MG, but titers correlate poorly with the severity of the disease. If you are highly suspicious for MG, but the acetylcholine receptor antibody test is negative, there are multiple other more costly, invasive, or time-consuming follow-up diagnostic tests that could be completed (ie: Tensilon test, electromyography, etc).</div>

Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors improve symptoms of MG only and do not stop the progression of the disease.</div>
