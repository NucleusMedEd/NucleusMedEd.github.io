- The SCM originates from the mastoid process and lateral aspect of the superior nuchal line and has sternal and clavicular attachments. Spasm of this muscle can cause torticollis, which presents with the head side-bent ipsilaterally and rotated contralaterally to the SCM that is in spasm. Unilateral contraction of the SCM results in side bending the head and neck ipsilateral and rotating it contralateral. Bilateral contraction of the SCM results in neck flexion. The SCM is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve, CN XI.
