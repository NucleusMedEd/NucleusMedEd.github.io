Neutropenic fever is defined as a single oral temperature equal to or greater than 38.3ºC or a temperature equal to or greater than 38.0ºC for more than one hour in a patient with an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm^3. It is a common diagnosis in cancer patients who are currently involved in a chemotherapy regimen, AIDS patients, and other immunosuppressed patients. The cause of the fever must be determined as soon as possible so treatment can be directed toward the cause. Blood, urine, sputum and/or wound cultures should be taken. A chest x-ray should be ordered for all patients with respiratory symptoms and a CT scan can be used to evaluate for abscesses or other occult infections. There is a specific treatment algorithm for treating neutropenic patients. First, patients are classified as low or high risk. Low-risk patients are those with solid tumors that are being treated on an outpatient basis with conventional chemotherapy agents, patients with minimal comorbidities and those who have had neutropenia for less than 7 days. Low-risk patients may be treated with oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. High-risk patients are those patients with any of the following: Anticipated, prolonged (&gt;7 days), and profound neutropenia (ANC &lt; 100/uL) following cytotoxic chemotherapy, significant comorbidities including hypotension, pneumonia, new-onset abdominal pain or neurologic change, taking high-dose chemotherapy,and patients with hematologic malignancies. High risk patients first-line monotherapy must include an agent with antipseudomonal activity. Quinolones and aminoglycosides are not acceptable as monotherapy. Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV q 6h or Cefepime 2grams IV q 8h or Meropenem 1g IV q 8h or Imipenem-cilastatin 500mg IV q 6h. No single agent has shown superiority in the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia. If any of these treatment regimens does not cause the fever to regress after 72 hours an anti-fungal agent should be added. A rectal exam should be avoided if the patient is thrombocytopenic because of increased bleeding risk. Any cause of bleeding in a thrombocytopenic patient may be difficult to stop but can be controlled with platelet infusions. In the presence of active bleeding, a platelet transfusion should occur in patients with platelet counts below 50,000.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B &amp; D &amp; E:</strong> This test should be performed to rule out an organic etiology of the patient's fever.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A rectal exam should be avoided in neutropenic patients if the patient is thrombocytopenic because of increased bleeding risk.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes" target="_search">"Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes" on UpToDate.</a><br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2012185-overview" target="_search">"Neutropenic Fever Empiric Therapy" on medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 3/27/2017</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>3 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/972901-clinical" target="_search">"Pediatric Tetanus Clinical Presentation" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Pregnancy/Childbirth/Postpartum/Neonatal Assessment<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Nervous System<br>Discipline: Pediatrics<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 20-year-old G2P2 female presents to the office after the birth of her second child one week ago with the complaint that the patient has not been able to breast feed over the past 2 days.

Most people with primary Addison's disease also have hyperpigmentation of the skin, including areas not typically exposed to the sun. Sites of hyperpigmentation include areas of skin creases (e.g. of the hands), face, nipples, and buccal mucosa. You may see viscerosomatic changes from T11-L1 as well as Chapman points as seen in this case vignette.&nbsp; The anterior chapman point is one inch lateral and two inches superior to the umbilicus, while the posterior point overlies the transverse process of T11.&nbsp; The side of the chapman point (left or right) may be useful in helping you determine which suprarenal area is dysfunctioning.&nbsp; The pathophysiology of hyperpigmentation in Addison’s disease is important and occurs due to the fact that melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) share the same precursor molecule. Therefore, an increase in ACTH production also increases MSH. Addison’s disease is often associated with other autoimmune comorbidities, such as vitiligo.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Conn syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism is an adrenal disorder characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone.

Early symptoms include severe fatigue (75%), impotence (45%), and arthralgias (40%). Skin bronzing (70%) occurs late in the disease process and reflects a combination of iron deposition and melanin. The classic triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation should be noted.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) commonly presents with weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation of the skin.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Remember that primary Addison’s disease is the only type that presents with bronzing of the skin.

Hyponatremia is the most common finding and occurs in 90% of patients. Hyperkalemia is also common can occur in up to 70% of cases. Hypercalcemia is uncommon but is still found in up to 10% of patients presenting with the disorder. Addison disease results in autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland. The resulting low production of mineralocorticoids leads to low aldosterone. Subsequently, the patient becomes hyponatremic and hypotensive. Low cortisol also contributes to hypotension. The distal collecting duct of the kidney is responsible for sodium reabsorption .

Weight loss (not listed here) should be a first-line treatment for overweight patients with PCOS as many women will resume ovulation after weight loss. Of these answer choices, clomiphene citrate is the first line treatment for ovulation abnormalities leading to infertility. Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator.&nbsp; It reacts with estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus which results in increased pulsatile GnRH release and subsequent LH and FSH release. For women not pursuing pregnancy, oral contraceptives are the first-line pharmacological treatment as they will restore normal menses and control hyperandrogenism.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Osteopathic Pearl:</strong>&nbsp;Viscerosomatic reflexes are a type of somatic dysfunction caused by changes in the autonomic nervous system. They can be acute or chronic, and are considered to be a somatic representation of visceral disease. When either branch of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic or parasympathetic) over-stimulates a particular organ, a reflex reaction occurs.

Epiglottitis is an acute inflammation in the supraglottic region of the oropharynx. In United States, epiglottitis is an uncommon disease due to the advent of the immunization against H. influenza. It is most commonly seen in the pediatric population although adult epiglottitis does occur, most frequently in men during the fifth decade of life. Presentation includes hoarse voice, fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, and preceding URI symptoms.<br> <br> As with any other pathology in the head and neck we see TART changes from T1-4 reflective of viscerosomatic reflexes.&nbsp; In this example we also see a posterior Chapman point near the articular pillar of C2 which corresponds to pathology/inflammation in the pharynx and epiglottis.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Bronchiolitis is an acute, infectious, inflammatory disease of the upper and lower respiratory tract that may result in obstruction of the small<br>

airways.  Because bronchiolitis primarily affects young infants, clinical manifestations are initially subtle.  Infants may become increasingly fussy and have difficulty feeding during the 2 to 5-day incubation period.  A low-grade fever, usually less than 101.5°F, and increasing coryza and congestion usually follow the incubation period.  In older children and adults, as opposed to infants, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is usually confined to the upper airway.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Croup is a common, primarily pediatric viral respiratory tract illness. Croup manifests as hoarseness, a seal-like barking cough, and a variable degree of respiratory distress. Stridor is a common symptom in patients with croup. The acute onset of this abnormal sound alarms parents enough to prompt an urgent care or emergency department visit. Stridor is an audible harsh, high-pitched, musical sound produced by turbulent airflow through a partially obstructed upper airway. Croup usually begins with nonspecific respiratory symptoms, including rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough. Fever is generally low-grade (38-39°C) but can exceed 40°C. Within 1-2 days, the characteristic signs of hoarseness, barking cough, and inspiratory stridor develop, often suddenly, along with a variable degree of respiratory distress.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Foreign body aspiration can be a life-threatening emergency. An aspirated solid or semisolid object may lodge in the larynx or trachea.  Respiratory distress, aphonia, cyanosis, loss of consciousness, and death occur in quick succession unless the object is dislodged. When the degree of obstruction is less severe or when the aspirated object descends beyond the carina, the presentation is less dramatic.  Sudden onset of the classic triad (ie, coughing, wheezing, decreased breathing sounds) is frequently not observed.  Presenting symptoms (other than cough) include fever, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest pain.  A history of a choking episode is not always obtained or may have initially been ignored or misdiagnosed.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) produces the symptoms of sore throat, fever, neck stiffness, and stridor. Retropharyngeal abscess occurs much less commonly today than in the past because of the widespread use of antibiotics for suppurative upper respiratory infections.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Acute epiglottitis may manifest with symptoms of stridor, hoarse, and a rapid clinical course.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/763612-overview" target="_search">"Epiglottitis" on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>9 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/763612-overview" target="_search">"Epiglottitis" on Medscape.  </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Sensory Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Respiratory System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 42-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of a sore throat for three days' duration.

The current episode of low back pain has been ongoing over the last 3 days. He typically manages his low back pain with NSAIDs as needed, but would like to explore other treatment options today. He denies any lower extremity weakness, difficulty walking, or radiating pain. Vital signs are as follows: BP 135/85, HR 80, RR 14, T 99.1 F. On physical exam, the patient is an obese male who is pleasant and in no apparent distress. Patient has limited range of motion in thoracic and lumbar flexion. Fascial restrictions are noted in the thoracic and lumbar region. After treatment of the two regions with myofascial release,<span class="Highlight"> the physician notes that palpating the transverse processes at the level of T8 spinous process are rotated left, which become symmetric with flexion of the trunk.</span> What is the most appropriate initial patient positioning in order to address his thoracic somatic dysfunction with post-isometric MET?</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">The patient’s trunk is extended, sidebent right, and rotated

The majority of thoracic MET involves direct post-isometric relaxation. In this type of MET, the physician instructs the patient to isometrically contract the agonist muscle. Immediately following an isometric contraction, the neuromuscular apparatus is in a refractory state during which enhanced passive stretching may be performed. The physician may take up the myofascial slack during this relaxed refractory period.<br><br>
<p>Upper thoracic somatic dysfunctions (T1-T4) use the head and neck as a lever to induce motion at the segment; lower thoracic somatic dysfunctions (T5-T12) use the trunk as a lever. On physical exam, the patient is noted to have a T9 vertebra that is flexed, sidebent left, and rotated left. Note the guideline or rule of three’s in order to note the location of the spinous processes in relation to the transverse processes due to the fact that the thoracic spinous processes are long and angled inferiorly. Due to this configuration, the T9 transverse processes are located at the level of the T8 spinous process.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>With the patient seated, the physician monitors the T9-T10 interspace with one hand. With the other hand, the physician uses the patient’s trunk as a lever to induce extension, right sidebending, and right rotation until the edge of the restrictive barrier is reached at T9. The patient is instructed to flex the trunk and turn left while the physician provides an unyielding counterforce. The isometric contraction provided by the patient is maintained for 3 to 5 seconds and then the patient is to stop and relax. When the patient is relaxed, the physician positions the trunk in order to engage the edge of the new restrictive barriers in extension, right sidebending, and right rotation. The series of isometric contraction, relaxation, and re-positioning is repeated 3 to 5 times or until motion is improved at T9.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The transverse process is located one segment above the corresponding spinous process. For example, the transverse processes of T9 are located at the level of T8.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The transverse process is located one segment above the corresponding spinous process. For example, the transverse processes of T9 are located at the level of T8. Additionally, flexion, left sidebending, and left rotation are the positions of ease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Flexion, left sidebending, and left rotation are the positions of ease.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The “rule of 3s” describes the relation of the palpable tips of the spinous processes to the thoracic vertebral bodies. The spinous processes of T7 to T9 are located a full vertebral body lower than their respective transverse process.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>The rule of 3s are as follows:
</em></p><p><em>T1-T3: the transverse process is located at the level of the corresponding spinous process</em></p><em>
<p>T4-T6: the transverse process is located ½ of a segment above the corresponding spinous process (i.e. the transverse process of T4 is located halfway between T3 and T4)</p>

She is currently in her thirty-second week of gestation and recalls these symptoms started about 2 weeks ago. She notes her symptoms are worse when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

Pregnancy, obesity, wrist joint overuse, and rheumatoid arthritis are all risk factors for CTS. Median nerve compression results in paresthesias and weakness along the nerve’s distribution. The median nerve innervates the thenar muscles among other muscles in the hand and forearm. This explains the thenar weakness many patients suffer. The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the palmar thumb, index, middle, and half the ring finger along with their respective nail beds. The reverse Phalen test is seen in the attached video. This test requires the patient to hyperextend both wrists and hold for up to one minute. If this maneuver reproduces symptoms within 1 minute, it is considered positive and concerning for CTS. Initial treatment involves use of wrist splints, particularly at night when symptoms are often worse. Wrist splints are the preferred treatment method during pregnancy. Systemic treatments are not desirable during pregnancy given the CTS often resolves once<br> the patient is no longer pregnant.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Offering this symptomatic patient, no treatment with observation only is not appropriate.  There are non-invasive treatment options, such as wrist splints, that are amenable and safe to help relieve CTS during pregnancy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Corticosteroid injections are often used to temporarily relieve pain and inflammation associated with CTS. While this may decrease swelling in the carpal tunnel, corticosteroid injections are pregnancy category C and thus should not be used in this pregnant patient with safe alternative treatment options.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used to temporarily relieve pain and inflammation associated with CTS. While this may decrease swelling in the carpal tunnel, NSAIDs overall are pregnancy category B and thus should not be used in this pregnant patient with non-systemic, safe treatment alternatives.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament may be utilized for patients with severe CTS that persist despite trying various non-surgical treatments. While this offers potentially definitive treatment by ligating the ligament putting pressure on the median nerve, it may result in further nerve damage, infection, and scarring. Surgery is not appropriate in this patient given she is pregnant at this time. During pregnancy women retain water which results in swelling.

Medical history reveals diabetes type two that is poorly controlled with insulin. He states that when he flexes his index finger it feels like it is catching on something. Occasionally his finger will even become stuck in a flexed position. He does not complain of pain, rather an uncomfortable feeling.

Trigger finger is a type of stenosing tenosynovitis. It commonly affects patients over the age of 45 and is more common in diabetics. It presents with a nodule usually located at the MCP joint of either the index or ring fingers. Patients complain of the finger “catching” and becoming locked in a flexed position. It is treated with conservative treatments such as stretching, splinting and ice followed by corticosteroid injections and finally surgery.&nbsp;A mismatch between the flexor tendon and the proximal pulley mechanism occurs in most cases of TF. Normally, the tendons of the finger flexors glide back and forth under a restraining pulley. Thickening of the flexor tendon sheath restricts the normal gliding mechanism. A nodule may develop on the tendon, causing the tendon to get stuck at the proximal edge of the A1 pulley when the patient is attempting to extend the digit, thereby causing difficulty. When more forceful attempts are made to extend the digit, by using increased force from the finger extensors or by applying an external force (for example, by exerting force on the finger with the other hand), the digit classically snaps open with significant pain at the distal palm and into the proximal aspect of the affected digit. Less commonly, the nodule is restricted distal to the A1 pulley, resulting in difficulty flexing the digit.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A ganglion cyst is an out pocketing of synovial tissue. It can occur anywhere in the wrist and hand but is most common on the dorsal aspect of the wrist. It presents as a painless mass. Although ganglion cysts can be unilobulated, they are most often multilobulated, with septa made from connective tissue separating the lobes or cavities. Because there is no epithelial lining of the cyst wall, a ganglion cyst is not a true cyst and, because of this histologic observation, the theories of synovial herniation or synovial tumor formation are not supported and may be disputed. Hyaluronic acid predominates the mucopolysaccharides that make up the fluid within the cyst’s cavity, whereas collagen fibers and fibrocytes make up the wall lining. The development of these cysts is histologically observable beginning with swollen collagen fibers and fibrocytes, followed by a degeneration and liquefaction of these elements, a termination of degeneration, and, lastly, a proliferation of the connective tissue, resulting in a border that is dense in texture.<sup><br>

</sup><br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Warts do not cause catching or locking of the digits because they are superficial to the flexor tendons.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A lipoma is a benign fatty tumor. They are uncommon in the hand and would not cause catching or locking of the digits because they are superficial to the flexor tendons.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Dupuytren’s contracture is also a common cause of locking of the digits, especially in diabetic patients. Dupuytren's disease is caused by a thickening of the palmar fascia and most commonly affects the fourth and fifth digits. Although the underlying etiology for the development of Dupuytren disease is uncertain, the basic pathophysiology involves fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition leading to contractures of the palmar fascia. Investigators have proposed several hypotheses for the pathogenesis of Dupuytren disease. Some theories about the etiology of the disease is that an individual with a genetic predisposition to develop Dupuytren disease experiences a second inciting event (ie, smoking, diabetes, trauma, alcoholism), resulting in microvascular ischemia. The localized ischemia causes two events to take place in the palmar fascia: (1) the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to hypoxanthine and (2) the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and uric acid; this conversion results in the production of free radicals. Free radicals result in fibroblast proliferation and the production of numerous cytokines. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is the most abundant cytokine in Dupuytren disease and, via its receptor, upregulates the production of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), fibroblast growth factor, epidermal-derived growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. This milieu of cytokines and growth factors results in the proliferation of fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts (the primary cell type in Dupuytren disease). Excess type III collagen production occurs from an increased density of fibroblasts secondary to enhanced stimulation and diminished apoptosis, as well as an imbalance between the collagenases and their endogenous inhibitors. Dupuytren fascia exhibits an increased ratio of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) to matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Trigger finger presents as a painless nodule near the MCP joint and can cause locking or catching of the digits.

The MMR vaccine may be used if CD4 &gt; 200, but the general recommendation is to avoid all live vaccines. Killed vaccines include influenza, cholera, plague, polio, hepatitis A, and rabies. Toxoid vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Subunit vaccines include hepatitis B (surface proteins).<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Hepatitis A and B vaccines are routinely indicated in children.

Patients with K. pneumoniae pneumonia commonly present with “currant-jelly sputum”, which is a dark-red, thick mucous. This community-acquired infection predominately occurs in the upper lung fields. K. pneumoniae is an encapsulated organism and grows very thick in culture because of the capsule. It is a gram-negative rod that will ferment lactose, but is indole-negative which differentiates K. pneumoniae from Escherichia coli. While K. pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia in alcoholic and elderly patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae is still the primary cause of pneumonia in this patient population. In addition to pneumonia, K. pneumoniae can also occasionally cause urinary tract infections.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Haemophilus influenzae is commonly found in pneumonia patients with COPD, and due to the vaccine, will usually only present in unvaccinated patients. H. influenzae is a Gram-negative rod that will not grow on blood agar, but will grow on chocolate agar, due to the requirement for heme and NAD which are present in chocolate agar.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Streptococcus agalactiae, Group B strep, is a common cause of typical pneumonia, and meningitis, in neonates.

The cauda equina is a horsetail like collection of terminal lumbar and sacral nerve roots inferior to the end of the spinal cord at L2. CES refers to the neurologic and urogenital symptoms that result from compression of the cauda equina nerve roots. Symptoms include bowel and bladder dysfunction, variable lower extremity motor and sensory nerve impairment, and perineal sensory loss known as “saddle anesthesia.” Bowel and bladder symptoms typically start as urinary retention and constipation followed by loss of sphincter control.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A large lumbar disc herniation may result in CES if it is large enough to cause compression of the cauda equina nerve roots. In a disc bulge, however, the annulus fibrosus is intact and disc material is not extruded into the spinal canal making bladder changes and saddle anesthesia very unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Urinary urge incontinence is not uncommon in women over the age of 60. However, it does not cause saddle anesthesia and is not commonly preceded by urinary retention.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> While this patient certainly does have lumbosacral somatic dysfunction, the more important and urgent diagnosis at this time, given the saddle anesthesia and urinary incontinence, is cauda equina syndrome.  Additionally, although this patient may have underlying SD in the lumbar area, much of her dysfunction may stem from the primary diagnosis of Cauda equina syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Conus medullaris syndrome (CMS) can present similarly to CES. The conus medullaris is the enlarged distal termination of the spinal cord superior to the cauda equina. CMS results when the conus medullaris is compressed. However, upper motor neuron signs such as spasticity and hyperactive reflexes are present in addition to lower motor neuron signs such as muscle flaccidity and loss of reflexes. CES presents solely with lower motor neuron signs. Symptoms of CMS tend to progress suddenly and presents bilaterally as opposed to CES which presents slowly and unilaterally.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Cauda equina syndrome can be distinguished by the following symptoms; isolated LMN signs, perineal paresthesia, and bowel and bladder incontinence.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Any surgical emergency is likely to be tested on your level 2 exam.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1148690-overview " target="_search">"Cauda Equina Syndrome and Conus Medullaris Syndrome" on Medscape.  </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>27 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1148690-overview" target="_search">"Cauda Equina Syndrome and Conus Medullaris Syndrome" on Medscape. </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Genitourinary Disorders/Issues<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Genitourinary System<br>Discipline: Emergency Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; ">A 62-year-old female presents to the emergency department with the complaint of urinary incontinence.

It is most common in the developing world and in areas of poor sanitation. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Many of those infected have few, if any symptoms. However, some patients can develop a more severe illness characterized by spiking fevers, salmon-colored papules on the trunk, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. If untreated, patients may develop constipation due to inflammation of the Peyer’s patches, bradycardia, splenomegaly and changes in mental status.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Clonorchis sinensis, also known as a Chinese liver fluke, is an infection found in Asia. It is acquired by ingesting infected fish. The flukes invade the biliary tree causing abdominal pain, jaundice and diarrhea.

The primary motion occurs at the articulation between the sphenoid bone and the occipital bone, termed the sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS). When the flexion phase occurs, the SBS moves cephalad, causing the midline bones to fluidly move into flexion. The midline bones of the cranium consist of the sphenoid, occiput, ethmoid, and vomer bones. The paired bones of the cranium will move through an external rotation. The paired bones of the cranium are the frontal, temporal, and parietal bones. As the SBS moves cephalad, the dura mater which is attached to the foramen magnum, C2, C3, and S2 moves cephalad also. The attachment of the dura mater on the posterior superior portion of the S2 segment causes the sacrum to be pulled into sacral extension, also referred to as craniosacral counternutation. The terms nutation and counternutation were created in order to decrease confusion between the terms flexion and extension. During the craniosacral flexion phase, the sacral base moves posteriorly into sacral extension, also referred to as counternutation. During the craniosacral extension phase, the sacral base moves anteriorly into sacral flexion, also referred to as nutation.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Nutation of the sacrum occurs during the craniosacral phase of extension. During craniosacral extension, the SBS moves caudad causing the midline bones to move into extension and the paired cranial bones to move into an internal rotation. Caudad motion of the SBS causes the dura mater to become more lax and the sacral base to move anteriorly into sacral flexion, also referred to as nutation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Sacral flexion is referred to as nutation when referring to a craniosacral motion. Nutation of the sacrum occurs during the craniosacral phase of extension, not flexion.<br><br><br><strong>Answers D &amp; E:</strong> Unilateral sacral extension and flexion are not physiological motions of the sacrum. Rather, it is a pathological strain pattern that can occur at the sacrum when there is a somatic dysfunction of the craniosacral motion.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>During the craniosacral flexion phase, the midline cranial bones move into flexion while the paired cranial bones move into an external rotation. A pull of the dura mater cephalad causes the sacrum to move into counternutation, which is when the sacral base moves posteriorly into sacral extension.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>31 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Fatigue &amp; Weakness<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Scientific Understanding of Health &amp; Disease Mechanisms<br>Body System: Head &amp; Neck<br>Discipline: Osteopathic Principle and Practice<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; ">A 19-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of fatigue.

When the flexion phase occurs, the SBS moves cephalad, causing the midline bones to fluidly move into flexion. The midline bones of the cranium consist of the sphenoid, occiput, ethmoid, and vomer bones. The paired bones of the cranium move into an external rotation in the flexion phase. Movement of the midline bones causes a decrease in the anterior-posterior diameter of the cranium while movement of the paired bones into external rotation cause an increase in the transverse diameter of the cranium.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The AP diameter does decrease because of flexion of the midline bones of the cranium. However, the transverse diameter increases because of external rotation of the paired cranial bones.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The AP diameter does decrease because of flexion of the midline cranial bones. However, the transverse diameter changes as well and does not remain the same.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The AP diameter does not increase and the transverse diameter does not decrease. In fact, the opposite is true. Due to flexion and external rotation of the midline and paired cranial bones the AP diameter decreases while the transverse diameter increases.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The AP diameter does not increase. It decreases because the SBS is pulled cephalad causing the midline bones to move into flexion. The transverse diameter does increase because the external rotation of the paired cranial bones leads to a widening of the cranium.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>During craniosacral flexion, the midline bones of the cranium move into flexion causing the AP diameter of the head to decrease. The paired cranial bones move into external rotation causing the transverse diameter of the head to increase.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 4/11/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>32 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/391129-overview" target="_search">"Le Fort Fractures Imaging"</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Trauma<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Head &amp; Neck<br>Discipline: Surgery<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department by ambulance after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision.

The majority is caused by motor vehicle collisions but they can also occur due to falls or assault. The Le Fort system of classification divides fractures into 3 distinct patterns. Type I fractures involve separation of the palate from the maxilla, also known as a low septal fracture. &nbsp; It&nbsp;results from force directed low on the maxillary alveolar rim&nbsp;with a downward direction and the fracture extends&nbsp;from the nasal septum to the lateral pyriform rims, travels horizontally above&nbsp;the teeth apices, crosses below the zygomaticomaxillary junction, and traverses&nbsp;the pterygomaxillary junction to interrupt the pterygoid plates. &nbsp;Type II fractures results from a&nbsp;blow to the lower or mid maxilla and has a pyramidal shape&nbsp;with extension from the nasal bridge at or below the nasofrontal suture through&nbsp;the frontal process of the maxilla, inferolaterally through the lacrimal bones&nbsp;and inferior orbital floor and rim through or near the inferior orbital&nbsp;foramen, and inferiorly through the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus.&nbsp; It then goes under the zygoma, across the&nbsp;pterygomaxillary fissure, and through the pterygoid plates. &nbsp;Type III fractures involve complete craniofacial disjunction with&nbsp;extension posteriorly through the ethmoid bones and laterally through the orbit below the optic foramen and through the pterygomaxillary suture into the sphenopalatine fossa. &nbsp; It results in a face that appears long and flat. &nbsp;One of the limitations of the Le Fort classification system is that a combination of fractures&nbsp;is often encountered although it is still the most widely used classification system for facial fractures.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A Le Fort I fracture involves separation of the palate from the maxilla, also known as a low septal fracture.

As no significant health history is present and the current symptoms do not demonstrate a patient with a severe infection, this patient can be treated at home with supportive care. This will include bed rest for about 3 days as well as increased fluid intake. It is important to emphasize to the patient hand washing and other measures to prevent the spread of infection to others.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Osteopathic pearl</strong>: A Chapman point represents the somatic manifestation of a visceral dysfunction. Most posterior Chapman reflex points are located between the spinous and transverse processes; they have a rubbery texture when palpated. The posterior Chapman reflex points related to the upper and lower lung regions are located at the T3 and T4 intertransverse spaces, respectively. The posterior Chapman reflex point related to the pharynx is located at the C1 posterior arch.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This patient is not demonstrating signs and symptoms of a severe or life-threatening infection, so there is no need for hospitalization. If the patient was hemodynamically unstable or had a chronic disease that was exacerbated by this infection, then monitoring in the hospital would be appropriate. Also those patients who are unable to care for themselves at home or are not tolerating oral intake (elderly, infants) may require hospitalization.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The influenza vaccine is intended for the prevention of infection by certain strains of the influenza virus. Most vaccines now contain a trivalent dosage that includes two strands of influenza A (includes H1N1) and one strand of influenza B viruses. The vaccine becomes effective about 10-14 days after receiving it. During this acute infection, receiving the vaccine at this time would not be effective in treating or shortening the length of illness. The vaccine is specifically recommended for children greater than 6 months of age, the elderly, those with chronic disease, and health care workers.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; D:</strong> Oseltamivir is recommended for prophylaxis and also for the treatment of influenza. Prophylaxis is recommended within 48 hours after contact with an infected individual with a dose of 75 mg once daily. For treatment, this drug should be initiated within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms with a dosage of 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. While initiating treatment prior to 48 hours has shown benefit for outpatient treatment, those with severe infection requiring hospitalization should receive the medication even if it is greater than 48 hours from the beginning of symptoms. This patient is being treated as an outpatient, thus oseltamivir is not recommended as it has been longer than 48 hours that he has been having symptoms.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Adults with influenza who are hemodynamically stable and able to tolerate oral intake may be treated with outpatient supportive care. Oseltamivir may be used in outpatients prior to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults?source=search_result&amp;search =oseltamivir&amp;selectedTitle=1%7E31" target="_search">"Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults" on UpToDate.</a><br> Nye, Z.

Posterior hip dislocations account for 90% of all hip dislocations, traumatic and non-traumatic. After undergoing total hip replacement, patients are at an increased risk for posterior hip dislocation since the posterior surgical approach violates the posterior ligaments, which subsequently become weakened. After surgery, patients are advised to refrain from positioning themselves with their operative hip flexed, internally rotated and adducted as this puts extreme stress on the posterior ligaments and leads to the prosthetic femoral head slipping out the back of the acetabular cup. This position is common when tying shoes, sitting on the toilet, or when getting in and out of the car. Once the hip dislocates, the femoral head sits posterior to the acetabulum, which forces the femur to rotate internally. This causes the affected extremity to appear shortened and internally rotated as in the above scenario. The hip may also be flexed, as this places the hip in a position of comfort. The most appropriate test to diagnose a dislocated prosthetic hip is an AP and lateral x-ray of the hip. As with any pathology or injury in the lower extremity, you may note TART changes from T11-L2 representing viscerosomatic reflexes from the lower extremity.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A bone scan is a nuclear test used to find areas of increased bone turnover, such as in Paget’s disease of the bone, bone cancer, metastatic bone disease, osteomyelitis and occasionally fracture. It is not the best test to assess for a hip dislocation, which can clearly be seen on x-ray.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A CT without contrast would be the next best step, but only after performing an x-ray. If there was any doubt as to the diagnosis based on the x-ray, a CT without contrast may be performed to better analyze the bony anatomy. However, prosthetic hip dislocations are usually easily seen on x-ray.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> An MRI is ideal for assessing soft tissues and the bone marrow and occasionally a fracture. However, while it can be used in patients with total joint replacements, it is not the most appropriate initial imaging study as it is expensive and time-consuming.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Ultrasound of the hip is useful for diagnosing a fluid collection within a joint, such as in septic arthritis.  It is not a useful diagnostic tool for this patient.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>When you see a patient with a total hip replacement who felt a “pop” then has a shortened and internally rotated lower extremity, think posterior hip dislocation. They need an x-ray and orthopedic surgery consult. This is considered an emergency and surgical intervention may be required.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>This patient has sustained a posterior hip dislocation as evidenced by the physical exam. A posterior hip dislocation will have a shortened extremity on the affected side and will be internally rotated. The danger with a posterior hip dislocation is that is usually it requires a lot of energy to dislocate the hip so the propensity for other injuries is high. There could be nerve and blood vessel injury with hip dislocations.<br> <br> Since this patient has a hip replacement in the past, and her hip dislocated. You need to get an x-ray to confirm the dislocation. Many prosthetic hips that dislocate indicate a failure of the hardware and the over-whelming majority need to go the operating room to fix them.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br>Miller MD, Thompson SR, Hart JA, et al. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review of Orthopaedics</span>.

This places pressure on the sciatic nerve as it courses out of the piriformis and down the posterior aspect of the thigh. Extension of the big toe comes from the extensor hallucis longus, which is innervated by the deep fibular nerve which branches off the common fibular nerve from the sciatic nerve. It is not uncommon to have distal parasthesias and weakness corresponding to the sciatic nerve distribution associated with posterior hip dislocations.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The femoral nerve is anterior to the hip capsule. It is not under strain in a posterior hip dislocation. It is comprised of nerve roots L2-L4 and innervates the quadriceps, iliacus, sartorial, and pectineus muscles. Sensory distribution of the femoral nerve includes the anterior thigh and the medial leg.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The obturator nerve also travels anterior to the hip capsule. It can be injured in an anterior hip dislocation, but not likely in a posterior hip dislocation.

It is comprised of the sacral plexus and branches to multiple nerves that innervate the genital musculature.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The superior gluteal nerve exits superior to the hip joint. It innervates the gluteus medius, and tensor fascia lata.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The sciatic nerve is the only posterior structure at the level of the hip and is directly involved extension of the big toe via the extensor hallucis longus. Pathology corresponding to the distribution of the sciatic nerve can be seen in patients with a posterior hip dislocation.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>On COMLEX Level 2 anatomy questions are more commonly integrated into a clinical scenario. The distribution of large nerves may be tested. Remember the course and distribution of the sciatic nerve. It is comprised of L4-S3 nerve roots and courses through the greater sciatic foramen. It divides into the tibial and peroneal nerves. &nbsp;The tibial nerve is responsible for innervation of the hamstrings (except the short head of the biceps femoris) and plantar flexor muscles of the foot.

An ultrasound of the thyroid is highly suggestive of a multinodular goiter and minimal tracheal deviation secondary to compression by the goiter. Pre-operative evaluation of the patient for a thyroidectomy reveals a history of gastric bypass surgery.

Parathyroid tissue releases parathyroid hormone, which is controlled by ionized calcium by a negative feedback mechanism. Parathyroid glands are identified and preserved during thyroid surgery, with close monitoring of serum calcium. Calcium is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which has the highest concentration of calcium transporters. Since ingested food bypasses the duodenum after a gastric bypass (GBP) surgery, total body calcium levels may further decrease, placing the patient at higher risk of osteoporosis. Acute hypocalcemia may present as perioral numbness/ tingling, muscle cramps or with seizures if severe. In patients with a possible underlying calcium deficiency, it is important to take extra care in preserving parathyroid tissue during thyroid surgery.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The majority of patients following thyroid surgery are admitted for overnight observation with monitoring of serum calcium levels. Though pre-operative evaluation with CT of the neck showed some tracheal deviation, the patient does not show symptoms of respiratory distress and does not require monitoring in the SICU.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Pre-operative evaluation of the nodules revealed a multinodular goiter, a benign condition. The main indication for the surgery is evidence of tracheal deviation and cough. Since there is no evidence of malignancy in the thyroid, there is no need for resection of the entire thyroid. Meticulous resection of the entire thyroid would only further increase the patient’s risk of possible injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> After GBP, patients feel full after ingesting only a small volume of food. Total food intake is greatly reduced and the patient must follow specific instructions for adequate nutrition. However, the above patient has just had neck surgery with only a past history of GBP surgery. Also, the patient does not complain of dysphagia or respiratory distress. The patient’s diet may be progressed as tolerated by the patient with no specific purpose for a delay.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Iron is also normally absorbed in the duodenum and is frequently severely deficient in GBP patients, especially females. While daily iron supplementation is often required, pre-operative blood transfusion is unnecessary.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Cautious preservation of parathyroid tissue during a thyroidectomy is especially indicated in a patient with history of gastric bypass surgery since calcium is mainly absorbed in the duodenum and such patients may already have calcium deficiency.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 11/30/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>39 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Osteopathic Principle and Practice<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 85-year-old female presents to your office with right-sided rib pain. &nbsp;She recently had an episode of bronchitis and feels that her coughing has made her symptoms worse. &nbsp;She has tenderness on the ribs directly over where the pain is located. &nbsp;In addition to your examination of her chest including auscultation of her lungs, you decide to evaluate her rib cage motion. &nbsp;You note that upon inhalation the right side of her lower rib cage doesn't rise as much as the left side does. &nbsp;The motion appears to be equal on exhalation. &nbsp;What is the somatic dysfunction that you are palpating and where would you anticipate finding a tender point that may be treated using counterstrain?</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Exhalation Somatic Dysfunction, tender point on the rib angle of right T10.</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Inhalation somatic dysfunction, tender point on rib 10 at the anterior axillary line.</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Exhalation somatic dysfunction, tender point on rib 10 at the anterior axillary line.</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Inhalation somatic dysfunction, tender point on the angle of rib 10.</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Exhalation restriction, no tender point would be expected.</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>The findings that are being described in this question correlate with an exhalation somatic dysfunction. &nbsp;When the patient inhales the right side appears to be restricted. &nbsp;Since we always name somatic dysfunctions for the freedom, an inhalation restriction correlates to an exhalation somatic dysfunction. &nbsp;Anterior tender points are associated with exhalation somatic dysfunctions (depressed ribs). These somatic dysfunctions are often caused by coughing, sneezing or overuse of upper extremity. &nbsp;Anterior points are found on the corresponding rib at the anterior axillary line. &nbsp;The lower points (AR9 - AR10) are associated with internal intercostal muscles.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This question IS describing an exhalation somatic dysfunction, however exhalation somatic dysfunction typically correlate with anterior tender points.  The tender point found at the angle of the rib corresponds to a posterior tender point and is usually associated with inhalation somatic dysfunctions.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This question is describing an exhalation somatic dysfunction not an inhalation somatic dysfunction. The palpatory finding for an inhalation somatic dysfunction would be as follows: upon inhalation both the right and left lower ribs moved equally and on exhalation the right rib cage didn't descend as far, it felt "stuck up". The tender point in this answer would be the correct tender point for the case as it is describing an anterior tender point which correlates to an exhalation somatic dysfunction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> This case is describing and exhalation somatic dysfunction and this would correlate to an anterior costal tender point.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Exhalation restriction is the same diagnosis as an inhalation somatic dysfunction.  This patient is reporting tenderness over her rib cage therefore a tender point would be a likely finding.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Exhalation somatic dysfunctions correlate with anterior tender points and inhalation somatic dysfunction correlate with posterior tender points. &nbsp;Anterior tender points for AR3 - AR10 are palpated on the anterior axillary line on the corresponding ribs. &nbsp;Posterior tender points are palpated on the superior border of the corresponding rib at the rib angle. &nbsp;We always name a somatic dysfunction for its freedom. &nbsp;in this case the freedom of motion was in exhalation and the restriction was in inhalation, therefore the diagnosis is an exhalation somatic dysfunction which is a common finding in a patient who has had recent episodes of coughing.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Nicholas A, Nicholas E.

Osteopathic findings include right rib 1 ISD, T4FRRSR, Right rib 4 ESD, hypertonic trapezius and scalene muscles on the right, and a shallow supraclavicular space on the right.&nbsp; Symptoms are reproduced by the maneuver as demonstrated in the attachment with a decrease in the radial pulse.&nbsp;<br> <br> The most likely diagnosis is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">carpal tunnel syndrome</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">cubital tunnel syndrome</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">De Quervain tenosynovitis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Guyon's canal entrapment syndrome</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">thoracic outlet syndrome</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>Thoracic outlet syndrome is a compression syndrome of the brachial plexus in the upper extremity causing pain, numbness, weakness and dysesthesia. Common causes of this syndrome include cervical ribs, muscular anomalies, injury to the upper extremity, or somatic dysfunction in the ribs, upper extremity, and/or upper thoracic spine as seen in this case. Repetitive activities such as reaching overhead, brushing hair, overhead lifting, prolonged typing, driving or speaking on the telephone can exacerbate the condition and cause pain. Symptoms include progressive unilateral atrophic weakness of the hand. Sensory deficits of the thenar aspect, as well as abnormalities along the T1 distribution, will be seen. The Adson's maneuver is a test utilized in the evaluation of thoracic outlet syndrome. A decrease in radial or ulnar pulse with the&nbsp;addition of the upper extremity is considered a positive test.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Carpal tunnel syndrome is due to median nerve entrapment at the flexor retinaculum and patients are often unable to grip normally and cannot oppose the thumb and index finger normally. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms are typically felt in the thumb through 4th finger. Over time, patients can develop muscle atrophy of the thenar eminence. The most common presentation is numbness and tingling over the first three digits of the hand. Pain is usually worst at night. However, the Adson's maneuver is not specific for carpal tunnel syndrome. Also, muscle strength of the bicep should not be affected.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cubital tunnel syndrome is caused by ulnar nerve entrapment at the medial edge of the elbow. Cubital tunnel syndrome presents with similar symptoms of Guyon's canal syndrome. Symptoms include tingling and/or pain along the 4th and 5th digits of the corresponding hand. Altered sensation in these fingers may also be reported. Muscle wasting of the hypothenar eminence may be noted on physical examination. Although, cubital tunnel syndrome and Guyon's canal syndrome are both types of ulnar neuropathy, cubital tunnel syndrome is less likely in this patient. This patient denies pain in the elbow or history of trauma to the area. In addition, sensation on the hypothenar eminence is not affected.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> De Quervain tenosynovitis is a painful stenosing tenosynovitis involving the first extensor compartment of the wrist. Most cases are associated with overuse. Patients present with pain on thumb and wrist movement with focal tenderness over the radial styloid. The abductor pollicis longs and extensor pollicis brevis are typically involved. Plain films are non-diagnostic but may show soft-tissue swelling over the radial styloid. Focal abnormalities such as cortical erosion, sclerosis or periosteal reaction may be seen. De Quervain tenosynovitis is not the diagnosis in this patient. He presents with wrist pain and a positive Adson's maneuver.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The ulnar nerve is the terminal branch of the brachial plexus. It is responsible for innervation to the muscles of the forearm and hand. It also is responsible for sensation to the 4th and 5th digits. Ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal may cause denervation and/or paralysis of the muscles. Anatomically, the ulnar nerve is entrapped as it passes through the tunnel formed by the pisiform and hamate bones and the pisohamate ligament at the level of the wrist. This produces atrophy of the hypothenar eminence and impairs both adduction and abduction of the 4th and 5th fingers. Muscle wasting of these digits may occur but is rare. Usually patients also complain of a “pins and needles” sensation of the 5th digit and the medial aspect of the palmar surface of the 4th digit. Physical examination will be evident for sensory loss along the ulnar distribution in the hand with preservation in the dorsal aspect of the hand. This patient complains of decreased sensation along the thenar eminence, therefore Guyon's canal entrapment syndrome is less likely syndrome.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A positive Adson's test is suspicious of thoracic outlet syndrome.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/96412-workup" target="_search">"Thoracic outlet syndrome" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/20/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>47 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Osteopathic Principle and Practice<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 49-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of low back pain.

Fryette's principles indicate that in type I spinal somatic dysfunctions, rotation and sidebending occur in opposite directions and in the neutral plane of motion. Type I dysfunctions tend to be group dysfunctions, where type II are typically only 1 segment. Fryette's principles correspond to the thoracic and lumbar spine only.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Idiopathic scoliosis is a 3-dimensional torsional deformity of the spine with a lateral curve of greater than 10º. While a type I or II somatic dysfunction may also be present, additional findings of lateral curvature are necessary on a radiograph and physical examination to make this diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The diagnosis of "type I somatic dysfunction: L2-L5 neutral, rotated right, sidebent left" is opposite from the rotation and sidebending findings in the case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> In type II dysfunction, rotation and sidebending occur in the same direction and in either the flexion or extension planes.

Dermatographism is seen in a small percentage of these patients. When the examiner writes a word on the skin of the patient it remains imprinted as erythematous wheals. It occurs when a patient has urticaria, otherwise known as hives. It is an IgE mediated reaction, involving mast cells and histamine release. This is also known as a Type I hypersensitivity reaction. Allergic reactions trigger IgE mediated hypersensitivity reactions and can present as erythematous wheals. These are pruritic, raised lesions that present transiently when exposed to an allergen. Treatment includes avoidance of allergens, antihistamines, steroids, and epinephrine for anaphylactic shock.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cytotoxic, or antibody mediated, reactions are known as Type II hypersensitivity. They involve IgM and IgG, which bind to a fixed antigen and cause lysis. Type II hypersensitivity examples include hemolytic anemia, ITP, Goodpasture's syndrome, bullous pemphigoid, Graves' disease, and myasthenia gravis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Immune complex deposition is a Type III hypersensitivity reaction that involves the release of neutrophil lysosomal enzymes.

Pre-renal kidney failure is characterized by a BUN:creatinine ratio of greater than 20. There will also be a lack of granular casts or red or white blood cell casts in the urinary sediment as there is no direct insult to the renal cells. Causes of pre-renal failure include cardiac causes (such as an MI or CHF exacerbation) and volume loss (such as hemorrhage or dehydration).<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cholesterol emboli may cause intrinsic acute kidney injury, characterized by a BUN:creatinine ratio of less than 20.

The patient's symptoms range from a dull ache, to a severe burning. The sensations radiate from the neck, into the right upper extremity.

The seventh (C7; 60%) and sixth (C6; 25%) cervical nerve roots are the most commonly affected.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Factors associated with increased risk include heavy manual labor requiring the lifting of more than 25 pounds, smoking, and driving or operating vibrating equipment. Other, less frequent causes include tumors of the spine, an expanding cervical synovial cyst, synovial chondromatosis in the cervical facet joint, giant cell arteritis of the cervical radicular vessels, and spinal infections.&nbsp;The typical patient with cervical radiculopathy presents with neck and arm discomfort of insidious onset. The discomfort can range from a dull ache to a severe burning pain. Typically, pain is referred to the medial border of the scapula, and the patient's chief complaint is shoulder pain. As the radiculopathy progresses, the pain radiates to the upper or lower arm and into the hand, along the sensory distribution of the nerve root that is involved.<br><br>The foraminal compression test, or Spurling test, is probably the best test for confirming the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy. It is performed by positioning the patient with the neck extended and the head rotated, and then applying downward pressure on the head. The test is considered positive if pain radiates into the limb ipsilateral to the side to which the head is rotated. The Spurling test has been found to be very specific (93%), but not sensitive (30%), in diagnosing acute radiculopathy. Therefore, it is not useful as a screening test, but it is clinically useful in helping to confirm cervical radiculopathy.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Lhermitte sign is an electric shock-like sensation radiating down the spine, and in some patients into the extremities, elicited by flexion of the neck. This sign has been found in patients with cervical cord involvement or cervical spondylosis, and also in patients with tumor and multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the Lhermitte sign should be negative in those with cervical radiculopathy. Manual distraction may reduce the neck and limb symptoms in patients with cervical radiculopathy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> This is a test for vertebral artery insufficiency. In a supine position, the physician flexes the patient's neck. holding it for 10 seconds, then extends the neck, holding it for 10 seconds. This is repeated with rotation to the right and left, and in positions that the physician would attempt to mobilize the cervical spine. The test is positive if the patient has dizziness, lightheadedness, visual changes or nystagmus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> This is a test for thoracic outlet syndrome. While monitoring the patient's pulse, the arm is extended at the elbow, the shoulder is extended, externally rotated and slightly abducted. The patient is instructed to take a deep breath and turn his/her head toward the ipsilateral arm. The test is positive if there is a decreased or absent radial pulse.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This is a test for thoracic outlet syndrome. The neurovascular bundle can be compromised as it passes under the pectoralis minor muscle at the coracoid process. This test entails hyper-abducting the arm above the head with some extension. The test is positive with a severely decreased or absent radial pulse.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The foraminal compression test, or Spurling test, is probably the best test for confirming the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/94118-clinical#b4" target="_search">Medscape: Cervical Radiculopathy </a><br> Savarese, R.

However, if one is far more tender you would elect to treat that tender point first then reassess and proceed accordingly.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> As stated in previous explanation, if multiple tender points of equal severity are identified in a row you would elect to treat the tender point either in the middle (if 3 or more) or more proximal first.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Although this could be an option for treatment as tender points typically correspond with somatic dysfunction and can be alleviated by treating the associated somatic dysfunction, you have already stated in the question that you plan to treat the patient with counterstrain and further details regarding an associated somatic dysfunction is not provided in the case.  Therefore you will be treating the corresponding somatic dysfunctions by treating the tender points.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The typical position for the treatment of posterior C1 located just below the inion is marked flexion and the typical treatment for posterior C3 is flexion, side-bend towards and rotate away.  Therefore it would be unlikely you would find a position that would treat the structures causing the somatic dysfunction at both levels simultaneously.  In addition, your positioning is fine tuned to treat the exact level for which you have identified the tender point and somatic dysfunction. It would be best to treat the most tender point first and reassess the other tender point.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>When treating patients with counterstrain, if multiple tender points are identified in a given region, treat the most tender of the points first then reassess the other tender points.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>DiGiovanna E, Schiowitz S, Dowling D. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Osteopathic Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment,</span> Third Edition.

The excessive amounts of plasma cells interfere with production of other bone marrow cells, which can lead to leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, the proliferating plasma cells release large amounts of antibodies into the blood. The clinical symptoms of multiple myeloma include back/bone pain, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, pathologic fractures, increased susceptibility to infections, lytic bone lesions and pathologic fractures, and renal impairment. Laboratory abnormalities include hypercalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and an elevated protein gap (total protein – albumin) which is normally 3-4 g/dL (5-6 g/dL in this patient). Multiple myeloma is typically a disease of the elderly with the median age 68-years-old and 70-years-old for men and women, respectively.&nbsp;
<p>The malignant cells of MM, plasma cells, and plasmacytoid lymphocytes are the most mature cells of B-lymphocytes. B-cell maturation is associated with a programmed rearrangement of DNA sequences in the process of encoding the structure of mature immunoglobulins. It is characterized by overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and/or light chains, which may be identified with serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP).&nbsp;The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of MM is an important area of research. Interleukin (IL)–6 is also an important factor promoting the in vitro growth of myeloma cells. Other cytokines are tumor necrosis factor and IL-1b.<br><br></p>
<p>Plasma-cell proliferation causes extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, anemia, and hypercalcemia. Mechanisms for hypercalcemia include bony involvement and, possibly, humoral mechanisms. Isolated plasmacytomas (which affect 2-10% of patients) lead to hypercalcemia through production of the osteoclast-activating factor.&nbsp;Destruction of bone and its replacement by tumor may lead to pain, spinal cord compression, and pathologic fracture. The mechanism of spinal cord compression symptoms may be the development of an epidural mass with compression, a compression fracture of a vertebral body destroyed by multiple myeloma, or, rarely, an extradural mass. With pathologic fracture, bony involvement is typically lytic in nature.&nbsp;Bone marrow infiltration by plasma cells results in neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In terms of bleeding, M components may interact specifically with clotting factors, leading to defective aggregation.&nbsp;The most common mechanisms of renal injury in MM are direct tubular injury, amyloidosis, or involvement by plasmacytoma. Renal conditions that may be observed include hypercalcemic nephropathy, hyperuricemia due to renal infiltration of plasma cells resulting in myeloma, light-chain nephropathy, amyloidosis, and glomerulosclerosis.The nervous system may be involved as a result of radiculopathy and/or cord compression due to nerve compression and skeletal destruction (amyloid infiltration of nerves).&nbsp;General pathophysiologic processes include hyperviscosity syndrome. This syndrome is infrequent in MM and occurs with IgG1, IgG3, or IgA. MM may involve sludging in the capillaries, which results in purpura, retinal hemorrhage, papilledema, coronary ischemia, or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (eg, confusion, vertigo, seizure). Cryoglobulinemia causes Raynaud phenomenon, thrombosis, and gangrene in the extremities.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is more common in elderly adults; however, the chronic leukemias are marked by prominent leukocytosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Iron deficiency anemia is a microcytic anemia caused associated with total body iron depletion. In the elderly, iron deficiency anemia should prompt an evaluation for colon cancer. The above patient has other findings in addition to the anemia making this a less likely answer.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Major depressive disorder is characterized by two weeks or more of sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep patterns, and decreased energy levels. Medical conditions should be ruled out before making psychiatric diagnoses.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> While malnutrition can be associated with anemia and fatigue, you would not expect to see renal impairment or hypercalcemia.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Multiple myeloma should be&nbsp;suspected in elderly adults with anemia, fatigue, and hypercalcemia. Laboratory abnormalities include hypercalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and an elevated protein gap.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>The characteristic findings in multiple myeloma can be remembered by the mnemonic&nbsp;CRAB (C= hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, Bone pain, lytic lesions, and fractures).</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204369-overview" target="_search">"Multiple Myeloma" on Medscape.</a><br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204369-overview#a3" target="_search">Multiple Myeloma</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 2/6/2017</em></p></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>53 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://www.emedicine.medscape.com/article/813959-overview" target="_search">"Cocaine Toxicity in Emergency Medicine" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Sensory Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Cardiovascular System<br>Discipline: Emergency Medicine<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 23-year-old male is brought to the emergency department in police custody complaining of <span class="Highlight">chest </span>pain.

Typical presentation includes diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, agitation and flushed skin. Patients may develop chest pain even in the absence of coronary artery disease. This is due to coronary vasospasm, which causes angina. It&nbsp;is important to avoid the use of beta-receptor blocking agents in patients with&nbsp;cocaine-induced chest pain, as there is a risk of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation,&nbsp;which can exacerbate hypertension and vasoconstriction.&nbsp; Benzodiazepines are the first-line agents used in the treatment of cocaine-induced chest pain as they mitigate the sedative and anticonvulsive effects as well as aid in controlling hypertension and tachycardia associated with amphetamine toxicity.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Although it would not be harmful to administer aspirin in this patient, its antiplatelet effects would not help to alleviate any of the symptoms caused by cocaine and is, therefore, not the best answer choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heparin is routinely administered as an antithrombotic agent.

Conduct disorder is characterized by oppositional and deviant behaviors. This individual has difficulty following rules. They exhibit antisocial behaviors such as fighting with peers, parents and authority figures. Criminality with stealing, vandalism and lying are common manifestations. Youngsters with conduct disorder often display cruelty to animals or people and/or start fires to cause intentional damage. Patients with conduct disorder often run away from home or stay out at night despite parental objections or consequences. These patients often have coexisting adjustment conditions such as learning disorders, mood disorders and/or substance abuse problems. Lastly, in conduct disorder this pattern of behavior has been present for at least 12 months and manifested before the age of 10 years. Conduct disorder usually appears in childhood as oppositional defiant behavior. Nearly one half of patients with oppositional defiant disorder develop conduct disorder by adolescence.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by hyperactivity, behavior disinhibition, inattention and distractibility.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A patient with intermittent explosive disorder presents with sudden, unpredictable outbursts that can be physical or verbal in nature. Patients with intermittent explosive disorder deny intent to harm people or animals.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A patient with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) presents with chronic argumentativeness and refusal to comply with adult requests. Although many features of conduct disorder overlap with those of ODD, patients with ODD do not display physical aggression and do not have problems with the law.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Schizoaffective disorder is a mental disorder that combines features of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder. Clinical manifestations of schizoaffective disorder include hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking with elements of depression or mania. To diagnose schizoaffective disorder the patient must demonstrate psychosis for 2 weeks without evidence of a mood disorder. In addition, there must be a period in which the patient has features of both a mood disorder and schizophrenia. The symptoms of the mood disorder must be present for a majority if the time of the illness. This patient does not report periods of delusions or depressed mood, therefore schizoaffective disorder is not a likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Conduct disorder is characterized by aggressive behavior and a deliberate disregard for others.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/918213-overview" target="_search">Conduct disorder on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 1/31/2017</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>55 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/779545-overview" target="_search">"Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Bleeding<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Hematology/Oncology<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A <span class="Highlight">36</span>-year-old <span class="Highlight">male </span>presents to the office with the complaints of easy bruising and bleeding from the nose and gums for the past<span class="Highlight"> two days</span>' duration.

ITP is a disease of peripheral platelet destruction in the absence of another identifiable cause, and is most often caused by circulating autoantibodies attacking host platelets. &nbsp;Bone marrow production of platelets is typically normal or slightly increased in patients with ITP, as are the number of megakaryocytes identified if bone marrow biopsy is performed.&nbsp;Acute ITP typically follows an infection and lasts less than 2 months, whereas chronic ITP often lasts longer than 6 months and does not have an identifiable inciting factor. Patients can present with life threatening bleeding as a result of their thrombocytopenia, and in this case, the ABCs and acute treatment with transfusion is indicated. In a stable patient the treatment of ITP is corticosteroids and IVIg.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of platelets and should not be used in patients with thrombocytopenia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Heparin should not be used in patients who are at risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.

The patient is 6 feet tall and weighs 215 lbs. &nbsp;The patient reports the pain is worse after activity. The pain is worse at the end of the day and morning stiffness is minimal lasting only a few minutes.

Pain is the most common complaint, and is often worse with activity and relieved by rest. As the disease progresses patients may have pain with rest as well. Morning stiffness, if present, typically resolves within 30 minutes, unlike in inflammatory arthritis where morning stiffness persists for greater than 60 minutes. On examination, joint effusions, crepitus, and palpable osteophytic changes may be present. &nbsp;The goal of treatment is to control the pain and swelling, minimize disability, and improve quality of life. &nbsp;Treatment should be individualized, however it should generally start with non-pharmacological interventions first. &nbsp;These may include exercise programs and counseling regarding healthy lifestyle habits and weight-loss.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acetaminophen is generally regarded as the first pharmacologic intervention of choice.  It is used over non-steroidal anti-inflammatories initially because it causes fewer gastrointestinal issues and is generally more tolerable.  Patients must be instructed on the hepatic complications that may arise from over exposure to acetaminophen and educated regarding the frequency with which it appears in common combination over the counter medications and cautioned about combining such medications.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Intraarticular glucocorticoids are generally reserved for patients with persistent symptoms in one or a few joints despite the use of both nonpharmacologic interventions and oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or in those in whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are contraindicated.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are frequently used in patients whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with acetaminophen or in whom there is obvious joint inflammation as acetaminophen is not an anti-inflammatory.  They may be used in combination or in replacement of acetaminophen.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Topical anti-inflammatories may be used in patients who cannot tolerate, or have a contraindication to, oral anti-inflammatories.  They may also be used in those who have an increased risk for adverse effects of oral anti-inflammatories, such as those older than 75 years of age.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Classic clinical criteria for diagnosis of OA of the knee includes knee pain plus three of the following six characteristics: Age greater than 50 years, morning stiffness lasting for &lt; 30 minutes, crepitus with active range of motion of the knee bony tenderness, bony enlargement, and no palpable warmth. &nbsp; Treatment should be individualized, but generally begin with non-pharmacologic interventions if appropriate and progress in a step-wise fashion.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/330487-overview" target="_search"><br>

He says that four days ago he was tending the grill at a family get together. He attempted multiple times with his left hand to see if the charcoal was ready by holding his hand over the briquettes. Though they were glowing, he could not appreciate the hot temperature. Upon further questioning, he also reports some neck pain that radiates down his arms and notes that the muscles in his hands are not as bulky as they once were. Physical&nbsp;examination reveals there is decreased muscle bulk bilaterally in his intrinsic hand muscles. He has decreased strength bilaterally in his distal upper extremities. He has loss of thermal sense and pinprick over his posterior neck and shoulders and down both arms. Deep tendon reflexes reveal the following bilaterally: biceps 1/1, triceps 0/0, brachioradialis 1/1, knee jerks 3/3, and ankle jerks 3/3. He has spastic tone in his legs and his right plantar response is extensor. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Guillain-Barre syndrome</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">rhombencephalitis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">syringomyelia</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">transverse myelitis</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>This patient likely has syringomyelia. A central lesion in his cervical cord, such a syrinx, can explain all of his findings. He has a dissociative sensory loss and he has intact vibration and proprioception but loss of pain and temperature over his shoulders, arms and hands (a cape-like distribution). This is due to damage to the crossing fibers of the spinothalamic tract in the anterior white commissure. The posterior columns however, are spared. He has weakness, atrophy and areflexia (lower motor neuron signs) in his upper extremities due to the direct involvement of the anterior horn cells in the ventral horns. The upper motor neuron signs in his lower extremities (upgoing toe, spasticity, hyperreflexia) are attributable to the effect of the syrinx on the descending corticospinal tract. This patient will need an MRI of his cervical spine and evaluation by neurosurgery for possible drainage of the syrinx.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> ALS is a syndrome characterized by deterioration of anterior horn cells. Exam findings will show a mixture of upper and lower motor neuron findings as this patient had. ALS is a pure muscle disorder. This patient had sensory changes, which would not be expected in ALS as no sensory structures are affected. ALS, also, almost always begins asymmetrically while this patient had symmetric findings. ALS is a progressive, devastating disease. Due to effects on the respiratory and bulbar musculature, only about 4% of patients survive longer than 10 years.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Guillian-Barre syndrome (GBS) is unlikely in this scenario. While GBS patients do typically have sensory findings, the more robust finding is a progressive ascending weakness. It is classically taught that the weakness begins in the legs and ascends upwards, but not every GBS case follows this pattern. Almost universally, GBS patients will have absent reflexes.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Rhombencephalitis is an older term and usually used interchangeably with brainstem encephalitis (though anatomically the rhombencephalon is the pons, cerebellum and medulla, but not the midbrain). There are many causes of rhombencephalitis-infectious, autoimmune and paraneoplastic. Usually, when the term “rhombencephalitis” is used, it is referring to an infectious cause. The most common infectious cause is Listeria. This patient did not have any signs or symptoms that are referable to the brainstem such as cranial nerve deficits. Thus, rhombencephalitis is unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Transverse myelitis is a demyelinating syndrome. It is unlikely in this case as demyelinating syndromes are more likely to affect young women. Transverse myelitis would also be expected to have a different presentation. Usually, there is full cord or hemi-cord involvement (Brown-Sequard Syndrome) at one or two spinal levels. The exam would more likely to show a loss of sensation at a distinct spinal level. The time course would also be expected to be slower as demyelinating lesions develop over days to weeks. Transverse myelitis patients will also describe Lhermitte’s sign, which is an electric sensation down the back with flexion of the neck.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A central lesion in his cervical cord, such a syrinx, can explain a dissociative sensory loss with intact vibration and proprioception but&nbsp;loss&nbsp;of pain and temperature over the shoulders, arms and hands in a cape-like distribution.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>This case demonstrates the importance of neuroanatomy.

Sigmoid volvulus is the most common type of volvulus of the large bowel and is responsible for nearly 10% of all intestinal obstructions. Plain films of the abdomen classically demonstrate a “double-loop” sign, which is seen in half of the patients with this diagnosis. Look for markedly distended sigmoid loops in the shape of a comma.<br> <br> In this vignette we also see information about TART changes from T12-L2, representative of viscerosomatic reflexes from the sigmoid colon, and a tender nodule on the left proximal thigh, representative of a Chapman point for the sigmoid colon.&nbsp; This information can help you determine the location of pathology in the abdomen but does not help you differentiate from pathology in the same region of the colon.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Intussusception most commonly occurs in children between 5 and 10 months of age and occurs when the intestine prolapses, or “telescopes” into another section of the intestine. Symptoms include nausea, bilious vomiting and intermittent moderate to severe cramping of the abdomen. Children who are too young to speak may cry and draw their knees up to their chest. They may also present with bloody "currant jelly" stools.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Pneumoperitoneum is caused by perforation of the GI tract, most commonly due to a bleeding ulcer or another perforated viscous. Diagnosis is usually made by history and upright abdominal films, which show air-fluid levels.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Fecal impaction occurs when a large mass of dry stool lodges in the rectum causing chronic constipation and does not demonstrate x-ray findings consistent with what is seen in the above scenario.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Viral gastroenteritis is a common diagnosis and is usually self-limiting.

Chronic constipation causes lengthening and dilation of the bowel. Elongation of the sigmoid colon can lead to creation of a redundant loop. Patients who develop sigmoid volvulus from chronic constipation include those in nursing homes, institutionalized patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, and those who use an excess amount of laxatives, cathartics and enemas. Diagnosis can be made with an abdominal x-ray, which often demonstrate a "coffee bean" appearance and evidence of obstruction at the point of rotation.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Viral diseases are thought to play a role in intussusception, although studies have not conclusively established this. Intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adults. Sigmoid volvulus is a much more likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children less than two years old. Intussusception is telescoping of a proximal portion of the bowel into a distal segment of the bowel at the ileocecal junction. Entrapment of the mesentery leads to the development of congestion, edema and ultimately ischemia of the intestine. Perforation and peritonitis may result if it not immediately addressed. Most cases of intussusception are idiopathic, however there have been some association with the rotavirus vaccine. Clinical manifestations include acute onset of severe, crampy and worsening abdominal pain. As the obstruction progresses patients report bilious emesis. Physical examination is remarkable for a sausage-shaped abdominal mass. History of intussusception is not a common cause of developing sigmoid volvulus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Large hernias are actually less likely to strangulate than small hernias and lead to less bowel ischemia. In addition, internal herniations are a less common cause of sigmoid volvulus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Prior abdominal surgeries are a less common cause of sigmoid volvulus. However, prior bowel surgery is a risk factor to develop a small bowel obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions occur in patients with prior abdominal surgeries secondary to intra-abdominal adhesion formation. Surgical adhesions begin immediately following surgery, and are part of the tissue healing process. Adhesions become dangerous when they impair peristalsis and result in obstruction. Other etiologies of small bowel obstruction include malignant tumors (20%), hernias (10%), inflammatory bowel disease (5%) and volvulus (3%). Risk factors for mechanical obstruction include anything that increases the chance of scar tissue development in the GI tract such as the following: previous abdominal surgeries (most common), history of peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, Crohn’s disease, cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, and Hirschsprung’s disease (in infants and children).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Sigmoid volvulus is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in an elderly patient with chronic constipation. The most appropriate first step in imaging is to order an abdominal x-ray.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>It is important to be able to recognize volvulus on abdominal x-ray.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults?source=search_result&amp;search=small+bowel+obstruction+causes+and+management&amp;selectedTitle=15%7E121.

He is currently alert, but not oriented to himself or his surroundings. After his initial assessment, he begins to seize violently. 5mg of midazolam is administered intravenously yet the patient continues to seize. An additional 10mg of midazolam is administered intravenously, yet the patient continues to shake violently for 6 minutes. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg, a heart rate of 130/min, a respiratory rate of 44/min, and a room air oxygen saturation of 88%.

Definitions vary, but generally speaking, SE is continuous seizures for longer than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures for longer than 30 minutes. This patient had two sequential seizures without clearing from his post-ictal state, followed by continued seizure activity following high dose benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are the first line treatment for seizures. When this fails, one must resort to the ABC’s of patient care. This patient has no ability to control his airway if he continues to seize. Immediate recognition of this is critical. Intubation is indicated for airway protection. Propofol is the induction agent of choice because it is a powerful anti-epileptic drug (AED) as well as a commonly used induction agent for rapid-sequence-intubation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Call for a stat neurology consultation is incorrect. The patient needs immediate stabilization of his airway. Remember the ABCs. Airway, breathing, and circulation come before all else. Once the patient is stabilized (via intubation and sedation), you have a high priority to call neurology for continuation of care.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Benzodiazepines are the first line treatment for seizures, and are effective in the majority of cases. This patient has failed high dose treatment with a benzodiazepine, and continues to seize. Therefore a different medication should be used. Frequently used alternatives are phenobarbital and propofol, which are both powerful medications used to suppress seizure activity. When using either of these medications, the respiratory drive will be decreased and therefore intubation is usually required.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation will not help this patient. In fact, forcing breaths into this patient will likely only induce aspiration and possibly produce aspiration pneumonitis. His oxygen saturation should be maintained by simple nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask that will not force air into the trachea or esophagus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This patient requires immediate protection of his airway. Rolling him onto his side may transiently help prevent aspiration, but has done nothing to treat the underlying pathology. A patient in SE can inhale saliva, blood and gastric contents regardless of the way they are positioned, thus making this answer incorrect.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Status epilepticus is defined as more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. Management includes high dose benzodiazepines and management of the ABCs.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Remember the ABCs in all patients who are critically ill. You will have distractions and other management possibilities. When in doubt, be aggressive about protecting the patient by ensuring they have adequate airway protection/patency, spontaneous breathing, and adequate circulation. Do not move on until these are stable.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1164462-overview" target="_search">"Status epilepticus" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>65 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="For more information, see: Van Kleunen J.

The excess copper deposits in the brain, liver and cornea lead to psychiatric disturbances, liver dysfunction and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea. Laboratory analysis will reveal decreased ceruloplasmin in the serum and increased urinary excretion of copper. Ceruloplasmin is a glycoprotein produced in the liver. It carries more than 95 percent of copper in blood plasma. This patient presents with a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with evidence of liver dysfunction. She has evidence of prior exposure to hepatitis B with decreased levels of ceruloplasmin. Therefore, Wilson's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that causes early-onset panacinar emphysema. A mutation in the AAT gene prevents its release from hepatocytes where it is manufactured. AAT is responsible for protecting the alveoli from an enzyme that destroys the connective tissue of the lungs. As a result, there is an increase in alveolar destruction and patients develop emphysema. In addition, the excess AAT in the liver can destroy the hepatocytes leading to liver disease. Chronic liver disease is evident by the fourth decade of life and emphysema is seen by the fifth decade. Patients typically report life long pulmonary symptoms and often were misdiagnosed with asthma as a child. The initial symptoms of AAT deficiency include cough, sputum production, dyspnea and wheezing. This patient presents with signs and symptoms of liver disease without evidence of pulmonary involvement. Therefore, AAT deficiency is less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder that results from obstruction of the cystic duct from gallstones. Accumulation of bile in the gallbladder leads to bacterial proliferation and inflammation, pressure and swelling. Risk factors include age, female sex, pregnancy, obesity and rapid weight loss. A history of ingestion of fatty, greasy or fried foods one hour before the onset of symptoms is suggestive. Nausea, vomiting and fever are typically present. Lack of fever and risk factors in this patient makes this diagnosis less likely. In addition, hepatomegaly, jaundice and ascites are not commonly associated with cholecystitis.<br>
<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by iron accumulation in the liver leading to cirrhosis. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have an inborn error in iron metabolism, which results in progressive iron overload. The liver, heart, pancreas and skin are most commonly involved. Iron deposition in organs leads to tissue damage. Most patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine laboratory analysis. Development of diabetes mellitus occurs in almost half of patients due to iron deposition in the pancreas. Symptoms include severe fatigue, impotence and arthralgia. Hepatomegaly, cirrhosis with skin bronzing is most common physical examination signs of hemochromatosis. This patient does not present with hyperpigmentation or diabetes mellitus. Thus, hereditary hemochromatosis is not the likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease that causes progressive cholestasis and end-stage liver disease. Females are more susceptible to disease and it commonly manifests around the fourth and sixth decades of life. Clinical manifestations of PBC include fatigue, pruritis, and right upper quadrant pain. Patients may also complain of dry eyes and dry mouth, resembling sicca syndrome. As the disease progresses, physical findings include hepatomegaly, hyper pigmentation, splengomegaly and jaundice. Signs of advanced disease include those of liver failure: ascites, spider nevi, palmar erythema and peripheral edema. In PBC, laboratory analysis is relevant for significant elevations in alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and y-glutamyl transpeptidase. Laboratory analysis in this patient is not suggestive of PBC and her presentation does not suggest a diagnosis of PBC. <br>

Autoimmune hepatitis is an autoimmune process of unknown etiology and is characterized by hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis. Autoimmune hepatitis may present as acute or chronic hepatitis, established cirrhosis, or rarely as fulminant hepatic failure. While this disease can present in patients of any age or gender, most often it presents in young women (70-80% of patients are women). The most common symptoms are malaise, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, and pruritus. Physical exam findings include hepatomegaly (83%) and jaundice (69%) in addition to other stigmata of liver disease. Serum aminotransferase levels are typically elevated in the 200-300 U/L range. The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis is made by laboratory serum testing including antibody testing and serum immunoglobulin levels. Liver biopsy is also helpful in making the diagnosis. The most specific serum antibody test for autoimmune hepatitis is the presence of anti-smooth muscle antibodies.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hepatolenticular degeneration, also known as Wilson’s disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene causing copper accumulation and deposition in tissues and manifests as neurological, psychiatric symptoms, and liver disease. This patient has only signs of cirrhosis and no mention of neurological problems. Wilson’s disease is diagnosed by a low serum ceruloplasmin level and high urinary copper excretion.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver resulting in cholestasis which overtime leads to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis is associated with the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and subsequent obstruction of both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts resulting in cholestasis which can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. 70-80% of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis have ulcerative colitis, however only 5% of people with ulcerative colitis develop primary sclerosing cholangitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with the presence of serum perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA), which are also associated with a variety of other rheumatologic conditions, including ulcerative colitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Viral hepatitis can either be acute or chronic due to hepatitis viral infections, most commonly hepatitis B and C viruses in the United States. Viral hepatitis is associated with elevated transaminases and a mixed hyperbilirubinemia (both indirect and direct bilirubin elevation). In addition, the patient may be positive for one of several virus-specific antibodies, not anti-smooth muscle antibodies.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Autoimmune hepatitis should be considered in the differential of hepatitis. The most specific serum antibody test for autoimmune hepatitis is the presence of anti-smooth muscle antibodies.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Memorizing specific antibodies associated with the most common rheumatologic diseases can score you easy points on test day.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br>Le T, Bhushan V, Gagga HS. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK: A Student-to-Student Guide</span>.

Based on the "Ottawa Ankle Rules" it is very unlikely that this patient has a fracture and thus does not require immediate imaging modalities. &nbsp;According to the &nbsp;"Ottawa Ankle Rules", X-Rays are only required if&nbsp;there is any pain in the malleolar zone and any one of the following: bone tenderness along the distal 6&nbsp;cm of the posterior edge of the&nbsp;fibula&nbsp;or tip of the&nbsp;lateral malleolus, or bone tenderness along the&nbsp;distal&nbsp;6&nbsp;cm of the&nbsp;posterior&nbsp;edge of the&nbsp;tibia&nbsp;or tip of the&nbsp;medial malleolus, or an inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps.

The idea of overloading the knee’s extensor mechanism is the fundamental principle thought to play a role in this syndrome, as noted in the patient above who has recently increased her exercise regimen. A wide Q-angle causes abnormal strain to the lateral patella during flexion and extension. Having weaker medial quadricep muscles (vastus medialis) than lateral quadricep muscles causes the patella to be pulled laterally during quadriceps contraction and cause uneven wear of the patellar articular cartilage.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The patellar tendon can become inflamed in jumping athletes and cause patellar tendonitis, or jumper's knee.

The restoration of sinus rhythm is performed in many patients with atrial fibrillation to improve symptoms. Indications to convert a patient to sinus rhythm include unstable hemodynamics, first episode within 48 hours, infrequent episodes that do not convert spontaneously. Unstable patients include patients with severe acute left heart failure, myocardial ischemia, or hypotension. Stable patients who are candidates include patients with new onset atrial fibrillation, patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who are limited symptomatically (worsening heart failure due to atrial fibrillation or tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy). Reasons in which it is reasonable to avoid cardioversion in new onset atrial fibrillation include patients who are minimally symptomatic with multiple comorbidities, where the risks of undergoing cardioversion outweigh the benefits of restoring sinus rhythm. Benefits tend to decline after age 80. Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are usually not cardioverted because it is usually of short duration and resolves spontaneously. There are also factors which decrease the likelihood of success of cardioversion including: atrial fibrillation has been present continuously for more than one year, left atrium enlargement, elderly, associated cardiovascular dysfunctions (left ventricular dysfunction), patients with recurrence while on antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Cardioversion is also less likely to be successful if the cause is thyrotoxicosis, pericarditis, and mitral stenosis. In these cases, the underlying disease processes should be corrected or optimized prior to cardioversion.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Osteopathic pearl</strong>: A Chapman point represents the somatic manifestation of a visceral dysfunction (for example, cardiomyopathy). Most posterior Chapman reflex points are located between the spinous and transverse processes; they have a rubbery texture when palpated. The posterior Chapman reflex point related to the myocardium is located at the T2 transverse process. Once a Chapman point is localized, firm pressure is applied to the point. Pressure is applied in a circular pattern with the attempt to flatten the mass, and is continued until the lesion is resolved or the patient can no longer tolerate treatment.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Diltiazem is indicated in rapid atrial fibrillation to slow ventricular response when there is no hypotension and there is no indication for cardioversion. Diltiazem is often used in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation when presenting with symptomatic rapid atrial fibrillation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Emergent cardiac catheterization is indicated in ST elevation MI (STEMI). This patient will eventually need evaluation of the coronary arteries for coronary artery disease either with stress test or cardiac catheterization, but it is not emergently indicated because there is no evidence that the patient is having an STEMI on the EKG.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Nitroglycerin is indicated in patients with chest pain on the acute coronary syndrome spectrum without hypotension. This patient does have chest pain, and unstable angina or Non- ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) could be the cause of this patient's new onset atrial fibrillation, but at this point the patient is too hypotensive to be given nitroglycerin.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Pacemaker placement is indicated in disease processes that involve the AV node or His-Purkinje system. Atrial fibrillation is a problem with the electrophysiology of the atrial myocardium.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>It is important to know the indications and contraindications to cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and it is especially important to know when to employ emergent cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics" target="_search">"Atrial fibrillation" UpToDate.</a><br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation" target="_search">"Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation" on UpToDate.</a><br> Nye, Z.

It is primarily caused by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone. Other causes include decreased esophageal motility, gastric outlet obstruction, hiatal hernia or diet. Foods such as alcohol, tobacco, chocolate, coffee and high fat foods may decrease LES pressure. Risk factors include obesity, age and consumption of a western diet. Clinical features include heartburn, dyspepsia or cough. Patients may report "water brash", which is a bitter, metallic taste in the mouth. Water brash is an accumulation of saliva and gastric acid that has been regurgitated. Hoarseness or sore throat, otitis media and chest pain are less common symptoms. Diagnostic test of choice in the diagnosis of GERD is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Asthma is a chronic condition characterized by airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airway obstruction. Most cases of asthma are an exaggerated response to numerous exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Stimuli can be environmental, infectious, or exercise induced. Signs and symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness/pain. Symptoms are usually triggered by exposure to antigen and worse at night. Asthma is diagnosed by pulmonary function tests. This patient presents with a normal physical examination, which makes the diagnosis of asthma unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Congestive heart failure is a clinical syndrome that develops when cardiac function is impaired and cardiac output is compromised. Heart failure develops due to reduced contractility and /or impaired filling defects. Most common causes of developing heart failure include ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Signs and symptoms of heart failure include dyspnea, orthopnea, nocturnal cough and cool extremities with diaphoresis at rest. Signs of fluid overload are manifest by jugular venous distention, rales and/or wheezing, presence of hepatojugular reflux and/or S3 or S4 gallop. Diagnosis of heart failure requires the presence of the Framingham criteria. Although this patient presents with a nocturnal cough and history of hypertension, her normal physical examination lessen the possibility of this diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A major side effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is coughing. Approximately, 20 percent of patients taking ACE inhibitors develop a dry cough. Women, particularly of black or Asian ancestry, are most susceptible. ACE inhibitor cough is linked to the suppression of an enzyme, which results in the accumulation of substances thought to promote cough. Although this patient takes an ACE inhibitor daily, she presents with other symptoms that suggest a reflux disorder.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> An upper respiratory infection (URI) is an acute illness that is used to describe the common cold. The common cold is a benign self-limited syndrome caused by a viral infection. The Rhinovirus is the most common etiologic agent accounting for up to 50 percent of cases. The common cold is spread by hand contact and droplet transmission. Risk factors for increased severity include malnutrition, chronic illness, cigarette smoking and immunodeficiency. It is characterized by nasal congestion and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough and low-grade fever. Rhinitis and nasal congestion are the most common. Colds usually persist for up to 10 days in the normal host. A URI is unlikely in this patient. Her symptoms have been present for months. In addition, she denies nasal symptoms and has a normal physical examination.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux include pyrosis, regurgitations and cough.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/12/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>72 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1234753-overview#a0112" target="_search">"Kohler Disease" on Medscape</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Pediatrics<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A&nbsp;7-year-old <span class="Highlight">male </span>presents to the urgent care clinic&nbsp;in the company of his mother for evaluation of a <span class="Highlight">limp </span>as well as <span class="Highlight">left foot pain</span>. History reveals symptom onset approximately one week ago with the presentation of midfoot pain. The patient's mother thought the child had stepped on one of his many toys and did not think to bring him in for evaluation. History also reveals that the child is healthy without any congenital issues. Physical examination is notable for pain over the dorsum of the left midfoot without visual evidence of ecchymosis over the affected area. Pain is not elicited with palpation along the base of the fifth metatarsal, medial or lateral malleoli. The patient is able to bear weight but demonstrates an antalgic gait.

This condition presents frequently in childhood and the etiology is not well understood. Most patients present with persistent midfoot pain, as the patient in the above scenario. Radiographic imaging will reveal sclerosis and flattening of the navicular bone. Treatment includes immobilization and activity modification. Most patients will recover within 6 to 8 weeks.&nbsp;Recognizing cartilage problems will facilitate early intervention and minimize debilitating long-term sequelae.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Freiberg's infarction involves osteochondrosis of the second metatarsal head. It is most commonly encountered in adolescent and young adult women. Patients complain of dull, achy pain on the plantar aspect of the affected metatarsal. Patients may have difficulty walking barefoot. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the affected area with swelling and/or crepitus on passive range of motion. Radiograph of the foot shows widening of the metatarsophalangeal joint with flattening of the metatarsal head. Sclerosis of the joint may also be appreciated. This patient has navicular involvement which makes Freiberg's infarction less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Kienbock's disease involves avascular necrosis (AVN) and collapse of the lunate. It is frequently encountered in individuals who overuse the wrist through repetitive compressive loading. It can also occur with fracture or dislocation to the wrist which causes damage to the blood vessels that supply this region. This patient presents with foot pain so therefore a diagnosis of Kienbock's disease is unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Panner's disease involves osteochondrosis of the capitellum, which is part of the elbow. It is caused by overuse of the area during development when the epiphysis is growing. It is most often seen in adolescents during ages 7 to 12 years, particularly in young boys and is seen often in little league baseball players. Symptoms include tenderness to the lateral aspect of the elbow with decreased extension on passive range of motion. Swelling with a possible effusion may be observed on physical examination. Radiograph of the elbow show fragmentation with sclerosis of the capitellum and irregular appearance of the joint surface. This patient presents with foot pain which makes the diagnosis of Panner's disease unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Sever's disease involves osteochondrosis at the insertion of the growth plate of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneal tuberosity. It is frequently observed in skeletally immature patients especially during periods of rapid growth. During these periods, there is increased metabolic activity in this area which makes it vulnerable to injury if overused. It is commonly seen in young females who are participating in sports that involve running or jumping. These activities can cause microtrauma to the area leading to infarct. Sever's disease is the most common cause of heel pain in active children. This patient presents with navicular injury which makes this diagnosis less likely.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Kohler's disease involves osteonecrosis of the navicular tarsal bone.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1234753-overview#a0112" target="_search">"Kohler Disease" on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/11/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>73 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1171206-overview" target="_search">Medscape</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 61-year-old male with a&nbsp;past medical history of coronary artery disease presents to the emergency&nbsp;department with generalized weakness, fever and difficulty breathing.

In the disease, antibodies attack the acetylcholine nicotinic postsynaptic receptors in the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles. Patients typically present in second and third decades as well as from sixth to eight decades as well. Symptoms of MG include generalized weakness and muscle fatigue. The fatigue is worsened by activity and symptoms worsen after exercise or at the end of the day. This fluctuation in weakness can help differentiate MG from other neuromuscular disorders. The disease can attack any muscle group although the ocular, bulbar and facial muscles are more likely affected. Approximately 50 percent of patients present with ocular symptoms. Proximal limbs are affected more than distal in MG. Physical examination may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Ocular complaints include ptosis, diplopia, and internuclear opthalmoplegia or vertical gaze paresis with pupil sparing. The ptosis may increase with sustained upward gaze or by holding up the opposite eyelid. Patients with bulbar symptoms are fatigable chewing, dysarthria and dysphagia or nasal speech. Facial muscle fatigue can cause an expressionless appearance. Respiratory muscle weakness is the most severe form of MG and can lead to respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is often precipitated by upper respiratory infection. Patients with MG often present with transient symptoms that eventually become more persistent and worsen over years.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 75 percent of patient present with limb involvement. The cause is unknown. There are many types of ALS but the classic form affects upper and lower motor neurons. Upper motor signs include muscle weakness with spasticity and hyperreflexia. Findings of a lower motor neuron lesion include muscle weakness with atrophy and fasiculations. Symptoms of extremity involvement include tripping, stumbling or foot drop. Classic history includes a "slapping gait". Wrist drop and cramping of muscles in the hands are reported. Patients may complain of difficulty buttoning a shirt or turning a key. Only a quarter of patients have bulbar weakness characterized by slurred speech and/or hoarseness, choking while eating and difficulty drinking liquids. Emotional and cognitive difficulties, such as depression, emotional liability, and impaired social behavior, can also manifest in ALS. Serious complications of respiratory insufficiency and aspiration pneumonia develop as the disease progresses. Patients eventually become bedridden. Physical examination is remarkable for muscle atrophy with spasticity and fasiculations, abnormal reflexes, nasal voice change and drooling. Extraocular movements are spared in ALS making this diagnosis less likely in this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Basilar artery thrombosis causes ischemia in the area of the pons. Occlusion in the basilar artery results in motor and oculomotor symptoms. Motor symptoms include paresis and corticospinal tract abnormalities. The weakness is initially lateralized and can be transient or persistent. Movements can be adventitious and resemble fasciculations. Patients can show repetitive jerking and twitching in limbs contralateral to a hemiparesis. Incoordination is a common motor finding. Bilateral ataxia is witnessed but it can be asymmetric and more severe on the weaker side. Weakness of the bulbar muscles, such as facial weakness, dysphonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and limited jaw movements, are common. Weakness is seen on the side of the face and contralateral side of the body. Bulbar weakness is bilateral. Oculomotor symptoms and signs are common in basilar artery thrombosis with ischemia of the pons. Somatosensory abnormalities are not seen. Patients present with altered mental status with motor abnormalities. This patient presents with bilateral symptoms making the diagnosis of basilar artery thrombosis less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder caused by impaired acetylcholine release from the presynaptic receptors. In the disease, antibodies attack the voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium flux across the membranes causes the release of acetylcholine. Symptoms of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome present with proximal muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic changes. Typically, patients report symptoms with gait or difficulty getting out of bed, chairs and/or climbing stairs. Muscle atrophy is not apparent and muscle weakness improves with activity. Autonomic dysfunction is unique to Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome. Oropharyngeal symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia and difficulty chewing are less common but can be present in Lambert-Eaton. Extraocular weakness is less common in Lambert-Eaton and respiratory muscle weakness is usually not a feature of the disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination. The cause is unknown, however a combination of environmental, immunologic and genetic factors are thought to be accountable. In the disease, multifocal zones of demyelination, known as plaques are scattered throughout the white matter. White matter of the brain and spinal cord are exclusively involved in MS. Gray matter, axons and the peripheral nervous systemic are spared. Women are more commonly affected and they typically present in their third or fourth decades. Symptoms can be monofocal or multifocal and most patients report a history of asymptomatic periods in between exacerbations. Clinical features include decreased sensory, muscle weakness with spasticity, and loss of bladder and bowel control. Optic neuritis is typically one of the first presenting symptoms in which patients complain of partial or complete vision loss. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is also seen in MS. This patient reports a steady progression of symptoms and lacks autonomic complaints making MS an unlikely diagnosis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease characterized by skeletal muscle weakness with preserved sensation and reflexes.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1171206-overview" target="_search">Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/11/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>74 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 61-year-old male with a&nbsp;past medical history of coronary artery disease presents to the emergency&nbsp;department with generalized weakness, fever and difficulty breathing.

In patients with myasthenia gravis, repetitive nerve stimulation to an affected muscle shows increasing decrement in amplitude of compound muscle action potential. This progressive decline in amplitude is seen with the first few stimuli to the muscle. A normal muscle will show no change in amplitude with repetitive nerve stimulation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> It is important to know the electromyography (EMG) results of a normal muscle. A normal muscle at rest is relatively electronically inactive. Action potentials are elicited as the muscle begins to contract. As the strength of the muscle contraction increases the number of action potentials increase. An abnormal EMG result can originate from a myopathy, neuropathy or neuromuscular junction disease. This patient has a neuromuscular disorder caused by antibodies called Myasthenia gravis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease of the motor neuron system. Needle electromyography results can be useful in the diagnosis of ALS. Electromyography shows fibrillation and fasciculation potentials indicating denervation. The motor units may be polyphasic and have high amplitude. Other signs of active and chronic denervation are fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves. Neurological examination in this patient is normal; therefore, the likelihood of this EMG result is not likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Repetitive nerve stimulation studies are used to confirm the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. In the study, a large amplitude is observed after maximal activation of muscle. Whereas, resting muscles in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome have a significantly reduced amplitude. This patient lacks proximal limb weakness and hyporeflexia, which are classic signs of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Therefore, this is not the most specific test.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Electrodiagnostic findings of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) are used to diagnose the inflammatory neuropathic disease. GBS is an acute immune mediated demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy caused by a viral infection. Electromyography (EMG) studies show a slowing of motor conduction velocities with decreased amplitude. Increased distal motor latencies are often seen in the peroneal and tibial nerves, which indicate neurologic demyelination in the lower extremities. This patient has a neuromuscular junction disease and lacks lower extremity complaints.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Patients with Myasthenia gravis show a decreased response to repetitive stimulation of motor nerves on EMG.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Agabegi S, Agabegi E. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-Up To Medicine</span>. 3rd ed.

The thymus is an organ located in the anterior mediastinum that normal atrophies as a person ages. Acetylcholine receptors are present on the particular cells that make up the thymus. Thymic hyperplasia is common but thymic tumors can occur. These tumors can be noninvasive or invasive. Patients with a thymoma can be asymptomatic. If the size of the tumor is large, superior vena cava syndrome can manifest. Pleural and/or pericardial effusions will present as the disease disseminates. Thymic carcinomas are more aggressive and can cause more symptoms from its invasion into nearby structures. Cough, chest pain, and phrenic nerve paralysis are common symptoms. Thymomas can be seen on CT or MRI. Thymectomy can be curative and provide immediate symptomatic relief.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> <em>Camplobacter jejuni</em> is a gram-negative bacterium that is a common cause of human gastroenteritis. <em>Camplobacter jejuni</em> is often associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that causes motor nerve paralysis. The syndrome typically starts abruptly and affects the peripheral nervous system. The paralysis is ascending and eventually compromises the respiratory system. Patients report a recent infection of the upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal system. Other common bacteria associations with the disease include cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus. However, Guillain-Barre can also occur in the setting of Hodgkin's disease, lupus or post-operatively. This patient has full lower extremity motor strength, which makes Guillain-Barre an unlikely diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hypertension is the single greatest risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Blood pressure reduction is recommended for the prevention of recurrent stroke and vascular events once the stroke is stabilized. The target blood pressure and degree of reduction is uncertain. Treatment should be individualized. However, those with initial blood pressure less than 120/70 mmHg should not receive antihypertensive therapy. For all patients, blood pressure reduction should be gradual. Also, lifestyle modifications that reduce blood pressure, weight loss, salt restriction and aerobe physical activity, should be recommended. This patient lacks signs and symptoms indicating stroke.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Although the cause of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is unknown, the current belief is that it is environmental. MS is more common in people who live far from the equator. Northern Europeans are the greatest population at risk for contracting the disease. Vitamin D deficiency from decreased sunlight exposure is the current hypothesis explaining the geographic variation. This regional risk is most relative before the age of 15. If a person moves to a different region after 15 years of age, the person retains the risk of their region of origin. Other risk factors of MS include infectious agents, occupational exposures, toxins and smoking. This patient lacks the classic history of relapsing and remitting symptoms that have progressed over time making this an incorrect answer choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Small cell lung cancer is a malignant cancer that most commonly originates within the lung. Approximately 40 percent of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome present with small cell lung cancer at diagnosis. The cancer is usually diagnosed within two years of symptoms onset. Patients with Lambert-Eaton and small cell lung cancer usually have a fairly aggressive and rapidly progressive course of symptoms compared to those without cancer. Presence of antibodies to voltage-gated calcium changes is present in almost 100 percent of patients who also have small cell lung cancer.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Patients with myasthenia gravis can develop thymomas that can be asymptomatic or symptomatic.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Agabegi S, Agabegi E. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-Up To Medicine</span>. 3rd ed.

These antibodies are present in about 85 to 95% of those with MG, but titers correlate poorly with the severity of the disease. If you are highly suspicious for MG, but the acetylcholine receptor antibody test is negative, there are multiple other more costly, invasive, or time-consuming follow-up diagnostic tests that could be completed (ie: Tensilon test, electromyography, etc).<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is the first study performed in a patient with symptoms suggestive of basilar artery thrombosis. It is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging procedure to give more detailed information of the brain tissue and structures. CT without contrast is sensitive for diagnosis of hemorrhage. However, the study has a low sensitivity for detecting ischemia. Spiral CT angiography is more useful in identifying patients with basilar artery thrombosis. This patient does not present with altered mental status, vertigo, nausea and vomiting suggestive of hemorrhagic stroke.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the test of choice in diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MRI is able to detect brain lesions in 90 to 95 percent of patients and 75 percent of those with spinal lesions. The characteristic plaque of MS shows cerebral or spinal demyelination with preservation of axons. Brain MRI is also used to monitor progression of the disease-showing amount of axonal injury and death. MRI is more sensitive and specific than CT in monitoring the evolution of the disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Repetitive nerve stimulation may be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of MG after antibody testing has been completed. An electrical stimulus is applied to nerves and should result in muscle contraction. In MG, muscles fatigue easily and the muscular contraction gets weaker and weaker with each electrical stimulus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The tensilon test, also known as the Edrophonium test, can be used as an initial test or as a follow-up test to acetylcholine receptor antibody testing to help confirm diagnosis of MG. While this test is quick, it is more invasive than a blood draw and edrophonium may result in serious adverse effects. Contraindications to performing the tensilon test include cardiac disease or bronchial asthma. This test would not be used for initial testing due to the patient's age and history of coronary artery disease. Additionally, negative acetylcholine receptor antibody testing occurs most often in patients with ocular MG. Thus, the tensilon test may aid in diagnosis of these patients as well as others you remain highly suspicious of despite negative acetylcholine receptor antibodies (given only about 85-95% have positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies). Edrophonium is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that decreases the destruction of acetylcholine. The drug has a short onset of action, and effects are seen within seconds and last approximately less than 10 minutes. In addition, there is a high false-positive rate and the test lacks specificity compared to other tests.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Testing for serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test for Myasthenia gravis.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective diagnostic tests are often the preferred initial step in diagnosis, particularly on COMBANK.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br>Myasthenia gravis in Neurologic disorders section of Step up to USMLE Step 2, page 184.<br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/11/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>77 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 61-year-old male with a&nbsp;past medical history of coronary artery disease presents to the emergency&nbsp;department with generalized weakness, fever and difficulty breathing.

no problem when he begins to eat his meal but does have difficulty finishing a&nbsp;meal in the same sitting due to chewing fatigue, especially when eating meats.&nbsp;Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.7C (98.0F), blood pressure of 124/88&nbsp;mmHg, a heart rate of 84/min and a respiratory rate of 20/min.&nbsp; Physical&nbsp;examination is remarkable for eyelid droop with sustained upgaze, weakness of&nbsp;eye adduction, upper extremity muscle strength 3 out of 5, with complete muscle&nbsp;strength in lower extremities.

Pyridostigmine, neostigmine, and edrophonium are common agents. Pyridostigmine is the agent of choice used for maintenance therapy. By inhibiting acetylcholine esterase, the concentration of acetylcholine is increased. Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors improve symptoms of MG only and do not stop the progression of the disease.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke can be caused by an embolus, thrombosis or hemodynamic compromise. Ischemic strokes account for 87% of CVAs. Sudden loss of focal brain function is a core feature of ischemic stroke. Headache with nausea and vomiting are common symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Risk factors include advanced age, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Initial assessment includes an accurate history and physical, neurological examination and immediate laboratory studies to rule out other causes for stroke like symptoms. In the evaluation of the acute stroke patient, imaging is imperative to confirm the type of stroke and most importantly exclude hemorrhagic stroke and stroke mimickers. Furthermore, imaging studies identify the specific vascular lesion and the extent of injury. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain without contrast is the first imaging study that should be obtained. The advantages of CT are accessibility and low cost. Additionally, contrast should not be used in order to exclude hemorrhage. This patient is not having a cerebrovascular event, therefore aspirin or anti platelet therapy is not indicated.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome. IVIG is a plasma protein given for immune deficient patients with immune deficiencies. By administering IVIG, the body is able to maintain adequate antibody levels to prevent infections. They can also neutralize harmful antibodies and inflammation produced by the disease. IVIG is as effective as plasmapheresis in treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Either therapy is administered for non-ambulatory patients with the disease who present within four weeks of onset.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Interferon therapy with recombinant Interferon beta-1a is used for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. This drug modulates an immune response that is able to reduce relapse rates of approximately 37 percent. Response rates can vary. Interferon therapy should be started early in the course of the disease. Side effects of the interferons include flu-like symptoms and liver dysfunction. However, the long-term benefit is still unclear.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Riluzole is a medication used to slow the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It is an antagonist of the glutamate pathway and has shown to reduce excitability. Riluzole is the only medication that has shown to increase survival in patients with ALS. However, ALS is incurable and average span of disease is approximately 3 years from onset of symptoms.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, provide symptomatic treatment in Myasthenic gravis.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Agabegi S, Agabegi E. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-Up To Medicine</span>. 3rd ed.

All four are maintained for the first two months at which point ethambutol and pyrazinamide are discontinued and rifampin and isoniazid are continued for the next four months for a total of six months of treatment.  Treatment may be extended to nine months in the setting of meningitis, osteomyelitis, miliary tuberculosis, or when pyrazinamide cannot be used (as in pregnancy).  Active tuberculosis classically presents with fever, cough, sputum, weight loss, hemoptysis, and night sweats.  The best initial test is a chest radiograph, which would classically demonstrate a cavitary lesion, usually in the upper lobe.  Sputum stain and culture for acid-fast bacilli should also be obtained.  Three negative results are required to exclude active tuberculosis infection completely.  The most accurate diagnostic test is a pleural biopsy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Due to the extended use of steroids, this patient's PPD skin test is considered positive.  Remember that positivity is determined by the size of induration, NOT erythema.  The PPD skin test is considered positive when induration is greater than the following:<br>

<br>

5mm: Glucocorticoid users, abnormal calcifications on chest radiography, HIV-positive patients, organ transplant recipients, and those in close contact with someone who has active tuberculosis.  <br>

<br>

Iodine deficiency or Hashimoto's disease are the most common causes of primary hypothyroidism. Classic symptoms include lethargy, weight gain, dry skin, cold intolerance, and constipation. &nbsp;Signs and symptoms can be subtle. Physical examination is remarkable for slurred speech and slow movements, weight gain, dry, coarse hair or hair loss. Bradycardia is usually present. Diagnosis is made by thyroid function studies, including thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine and trioothryroxidine levels.&nbsp; This patient also exhibits viscerosomatic reflexes from T1-4 and a chapman point at the TP of T2, which may both be present with any type of thyroid pathology.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that is defined as a nonspecific syndrome of reduced cognitive ability in a previous unimpaired person. There are several forms of dementia: Alzheimer's disease, Vascular dementia, Fronto-temporal dementia, and Dementia with Lewy bodies. Dementia is most common in elderly persons with age being the biggest risk factor. The disease is characterized by a loss of memory, with a marked reduction in the ability to learn, reason, retain, or recall past experiences. Eventually thoughts, feelings, and activities are affected. Altered mental status and behavioral changes are noted on exam.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Major depression disorder is a mental disorder characterized by anhedonia, low mood and sadness. Late-life depression is typically under diagnosed and inadequately treated. Risk factors for developing late life depression include female sex, social isolation, insomnia, uncontrolled pain or comorbidities. Dysmorphic mood is a hallmark sign in the elderly. Irritability, mood swings, sadness or heaviness may be expressed. Hopelessness or helplessness may occupy their thoughts. Most can present with a normal appearance. However, severe depression can cause a decline in grooming and hygiene with noticeable weight change. Other signs may be a flat affect, restlessness or psychomotor retardation. Untreated late life depression can increase a patient's risk to develop dementia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Hypoglycemia is characterized by a syndrome of altered mental status and/or sympathetic nervous system stimulation due to a reduced plasma glucose concentration. Most patients become symptomatic at a serum glucose less than 50 mg/dL. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hepatic cirrhosis or other endocrine diseases. Symptoms include headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. Neurogenic affects include diaphoresis, tremor, paresthesias, dizziness and diplopia. Hypoglycemia is confirmed by a low blood sugar, presence of symptoms and reversal of symptoms when blood glucose returns to normal.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin that is excreted through the urine.

Here the pH is 7.2 which points to acidemia.<br> 2) Determine if it is primarily metabolic or respiratory disorder. With a very low HCO3, the primary disorder is metabolic. <br> 3) Calculate the anion gap via [Na - (Cl + HCO3)] with a normal anion gap being 12-16. This case displays a high anion gap of 31. <br> 4) Use Winters formula [(1.5 x HCO3) + 8 ± 2] to calculate an expected value for pCO2 to determine whether pCO2 is low due to an appropriate respiratory compensation or if its lower than expected indicating a concomitant primary respiratory alkalosis. In this case, the expected pCO2 is 28.5 - 32.5 which corresponds to the actual pCO2 indicating an appropriate respiratory compensation for the high anion gap metabolic acidosis. <br> 5) Lastly, calculate a corrected HCO3 to determine if there is a combination of acid-base disorders via [(measured anion gap - normal anion gap of 12) + HCO3]. In this case, [(31 - 12) + 15] = 34. The corrected HCO3 is greater than a normal HCO3 of about 24 indicating a concomitant metabolic alkalosis with the high anion gap acidosis. <br> <br> This patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis likely caused by an infection and a metabolic alkalosis from vomiting.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an elevated arterial pCO2 and a low arterial pH. Acute respiratory acidosis is defined as an increase in arterial pCO2 concentration above the reference range of 35-45 mmHg with a reduction in pH whereas patients with chronic respiratory acidosis may not have an alteration in pH. An acute respiratory acidosis superimposed on chronic respiratory acidosis would result in an elevated pCO2, a mildly elevated bicarbonate and a low pH.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in serum bicarbonate concentration and pH. The most common causes of metabolic alkalosis include diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting. A mixed disorder of metabolic alkalosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis could cause the pH to equilibrate to normal or near normal levels.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Respiratory acidosis is an acid base disorder that is caused by alveolar hypoventilation. Alveolar hypoventilation results in an increase in pCO2 or hypercapnia. In turn, hypercapnia decreases the HCO3 and pH. The compensatory response to acute respiratory acidosis should increase the serum HCO3 by about 1 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg elevation in the pCO2. The higher than expected value of bicarbonate is mostly due to a superimposed metabolic alkalosis which has increased the serum HCO3 from the expected value in a simple respiratory acidosis. In addition, the pH may normalize from this mixed disorder. Metabolic alkalosis is an increase in serum HCO3 concentration and pH.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Metabolic acidosis is an acid-base disorder that results from a primary decrease in serum HCO3 with a subsequent decrease in pH (less than 7.35). The compensation for a drop in pH is hyperventilation which results in a decrease in pCO2 of 1-1.3 mmHg for every 1 mEq/L drop in serum HCO3 concentration. Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a low arterial pCO2 and increases arterial pH.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Approach acid-base disorders in a systematic way.

Acute respiratory acidosis is defined as an increase in arterial pCO2 concentration above the reference range of 35-45 mmHg with a reduction in pH whereas patients with chronic respiratory acidosis may not have an alteration in pH. An acute respiratory acidosis superimposed on chronic respiratory acidosis would result in elevated pCO2, a mildy elevated bicarbonate and a low pH. This patient presents with a pneumonia superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which increases the already mildly elevated pCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Metabolic acidosis is an acid-base disorder that results from a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate ion, HCO3, (normal range is 22-28 mmHg) with a subsequent decrease in pH (less than 7.35). The anion gap is the difference between the concentration of the major measured cation, Na, and the major measured anions, Cl and HCO3. A normal anion gap is 3 to 10 meq/L. Non-anion gap, or hyperchloremic acidosis is a state in which the acidosis is not accompanied by an accumulation of anions. Causes of non-AG metabolic acidosis include gastrointestinal losses such as diarrhea or a renal acidification defect. An increased anion gap metabolic acidosis is a state in which the accumulating acid is not the HCl ion, leading to a greater number of unmeasured anions in the serum. The major causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis are lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, acute or chronic kidney disease, salicylate poisoning or toxic alcohol ingestion. A mixed acid base disorder of anion gap metabolic acidosis and normal anion gap acidosis should decrease the concentration of bicarbonate further, relative to the change in the anion gap. This signifies that there is another process present requiring buffering by bicarbonate. Some examples of this disorder include progressive renal failure, lactic acidosis superimposed on severe diarrhea and diabetic ketoacidosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in serum bicarbonate ion concentration and pH. The most common causes of metabolic alkalosis include diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting. A mixed disorder of metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis would cause the pCO2 and HCO3 to equilibrate with a pH near normal levels. The anion gap should still be elevated.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Respiratory acidosis is an acid base disorder that is caused by alveolar hypoventilation. Alveolar hypoventilation results in an increase in pCO2 or hypercapnia. In turn, hypercapnia decreases the HCO3 and pH. The compensatory response to acute respiratory acidosis should increase the serum HCO3 by about 1 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg elevation in the pCO2. The higher than expected value of bicarbonate is mostly due to a superimposed metabolic alkalosis which has increased the serum HCO3 from the expected value in a simple respiratory acidosis. In addition, the pH may normalize from this mixed disorder. Metabolic alkalosis is an increase in serum HCO3 concentration and pH. The most common causes of metabolic alkalosis include diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Metabolic acidosis is an acid-base disorder that results from a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate ion, HCO3, (normal range is 22-28 mmHg) with a subsequent decrease in pH (less than 7.35). The compensation for a drop in pH is alveolar hyperventilation which results in a decrease in pCO2 of 1-1.3 mmHg for every 1 mEq/L drop in serum HCO3 concentration. Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by a low arterial pCO2 and a high arterial pH.

The HCO3 is low at 19 indicating a metabolic acidosis. Calculating the anion gap [Na of 135 - (Cl of 104 + HCO3 of 19)] = 12 determines this is a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis as this is within normal anion gap range. The compensation for metabolic acidosis is hyperventilation resulting in decrease in pCO2 of 1-1.3 mmHg for every 1 mEq/L drop in HCO3.

The reference range of serum or plasma glucose is less than 140 mg/dL at 2 hours after a 75-g glucose load. Approximately 25% of patients with either impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose will develop type-2 diabetes over the following 3–5 years. However, the results of a glucose tolerance test cannot distinguish between type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus, and cannot be used to predict response to therapy, or likelihood of future complications. Although glucose tolerance testing is more specific than other options, fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c testing are usually more convenient and thus are used more frequently for screening. Higher plasma glucose levels are linked to increased cardiovascular risk, with this risk increase extending into the non-diabetic range. Impaired glucose tolerance (as demonstrated on a GTT) has also been demonstrated to be a better predictor of increased cardiovascular risk and mortality than fasting glucose. the presence of any one of the following criteria supports the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: 1) Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) = 6.5% 2) Fasting plasma glucose = &gt;126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) 3) A 2-hour plasma glucose level = 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during a 75-g OGTT 4) A random plasma glucose level = 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l) in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B:</strong> A fasting plasma glucose greater than 126mg/dL on 1 occasion can be used as provisional diagnostic criteria for DM. However this question asks for the diagnostic criteria for a 2-hour glucose tolerance test.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A glucose level above 300mg/dL is too high as a cut-off for any of the diagnostic criteria for DM.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A positive diagnostic criteria for DM after a 75g oral glucose tolerance test is a glucose level above 200mg/dL. It does not require the patient to have symptoms. On the other hand, a random plasma glucose that is above 200mg/dL and the patient has symptoms is considered a positive diagnostic criteria for DM.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The diagnosis of DM can be made with a fasting plasma glucose greater than 126mg/dL, a random plasma glucose greater than 200mg/dL with symptoms, or a 2-hour glucose tolerance test glucose greater than 200mg/dL. Each of the diagnostic tests should be confirmed on a second occasion if there is doubt of hyperglycemia. If there is clear evidence such as hyperglycemic episode there is no need to repeat diagnostic testing.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117853-overview" target="_search">"Type 2 diabetes mellitus" on Medscape.</a><br> Nye, Z.

In addition to many other medications, administration of an anticoagulant is indicated in NSTEMI. Anticoagulant medications, such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin), help prevent further thrombus formation and reinfarction. Overall, clinical trials have shown that low molecular weight heparin results in a statistically significant reduction in the rate of death or urgent revascularization and is superior to unfractionated heparin and, thus, is usually the preferred anticoagulant in unstable angina and NSTEMI. Additionally, in both low and high-risk patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, pharmacologic treatment should be started immediately with consideration for surgical intervention in patients that do not respond to drug therapy. Other important medications for NSTEMI include antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, as well as some types of arrhythmia. Calcium channel blockers cause coronary vasodilation, afterload reduction and also have an effect on heart contractility. Calcium channel blockers are considered second-line treatment compared to beta blocker therapy. These agents have not shown to lower mortality in coronary artery disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Administration of morphine is often used in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI whose symptoms are not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. While pain control is important, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association deem anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies a level A recommendation to be implemented immediately, while morphine is only a level C recommendation to be considered after nitroglycerin is attempted. Additionally, morphine offers no mortality reduction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> While thrombolytics reduce mortality in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), they are not indicated in patients with NSTEMI. Overall, data suggests thrombolytic therapy is harmful in patients with NSTEMI and may cause reinfarction or hemorrhage. On the other hand, thrombolytics should be administered to a STEMI patient if percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed within 90 minutes, chest pain began within the past 12 hours, and the patient has no contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) is a cardiac marker used to assist in the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction. CK-MB is released into the serum after myocardial damage. CK-MB should not be used for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. It is less sensitive and specific than troponin. Given we already know the patient has an elevated troponin I, a CK-MB is of no benefit at this time.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Low molecular weight heparin is a first-line treatment in NSTEMI, in addition to antiplatelet therapy.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/content/102/10/1193.long#sec-20" target="_search">Braunwald E et al.

The extent and severity of coronary heart disease can be identified on angiography. Specifics, such as patient prognosis as well as optimal management are provided by the test. However, the functional capacity of a single vessel cannot be ascertained with angiography. Coronary angiography is indicated in patients with symptoms in spite of maximal medical treatment and for those considered high risk. This patient presents with active symptoms of non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and therefore should proceed to coronary angiography to determine whether revascularization is needed.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) uses a 3-dimensional analysis to view the heart and its structures with high-resolution. CMR provides a greater sensitivity compared to dobutamine stress echocardiography. The negative drawbacks to CMR are patient intolerance, cost and contraindications to use. These contraindications include medical instability and/or medical devices. However, CMR has limited utility as the initial stress imaging modality due to lack of availability and associated expertise.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Stress echocardiography demonstrates the extent of coronary artery disease and ischemia by observation of cardiac wall abnormalities. Pharmacological stress echocardiography is preferred in patients that are unable to perform treadmill exercise. Dobutamine is a pharmacological agent that increases heart rate and myocardial contractility. In contrast to exercise echocardiography, this technique is able to see the heart at variable stress levels and at peak stress. Although stress test without imaging is the preferred initial test in a patient who presents with cardiac chest pain, stress test with imaging is preferred in a certain subset of patients. Assessment of myocardial viability and visualization of cardiac lesions provides more information than a stress test without imaging. One indication for additional imaging includes those with preexisting electrographic abnormalities that may interfere with ECG monitoring such as a left bundle branch block or those with a ventricular paced rhythm. Also, patients that are unable to physically attempt the exercise component of the stress test are recommended to take this test. Patients with unstable angina have a higher risk of adverse effects during stress testing. This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, therefore this patient should proceed to coronary angiography.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Doppler echocardiography is used to measure left ventricular systolic function, valvular function and pulmonary artery pressure. Most patients with stable angina do not need a doppler echocardiography. Use of this imaging device is indicated in patients with prior myocardial infarction, undiagnosed heart murmur, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and complex ventricular arrhythmias. Doppler echocardiography is utilized in individuals to assess the presence of a valvular heart disease. This patient does not present with signs or symptoms that indicate the need for a doppler echocardiography.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Exercise with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is the initial cardiac stress test of choice in patients with exertional chest pain. The exercise stress test is preferred to pharmacological stress test because it provides the most information regarding a patients' symptoms and hemodynamic response during normal forms of activity. Furthermore, the inability to perform an exercise stress test is a negative predictor of chronic heart disease. Although this test has low sensitivity and specificity compared to other options, exercise ECG testing is cost-effective and able to identify patients at low and high risk. A 1-mm depression of the ST segment during exercise is characteristic of ischemic disease. A depression greater than 2 mm is a sign of severe ischemic disease and represents a poor prognosis. However, exercise with ECG is not appropriate in patients who cannot perform the appropriate work load and/or individuals with baseline ECG abnormalities that may obscure the final diagnosis. Other absolute contraindications include acute myocardial infarction within 2 days, unstable angina, and/or uncontrolled heart failure. This patient would be an inappropriate candidate and therefore should not undergo exercise electrocardiogram testing.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Coronary angiography is the most accurate method to diagnosis coronary artery disease and is recommended in high risk or symptomatic patients.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="ezproxy.pcom.edu:2059/contents/image?imageKey=CARD%2F87155&amp;topicKey=CARD%2F5300&amp;source=see_link " target="_search">Stress testing on Uptodate</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/12/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>96 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://ezproxy.pcom.edu:2059/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease?source=search_result&amp;search=cabg+diabetes&amp;selectedTitle=1%7E150#H32 " target="_search">CABG on Uptodate</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Disease Detection &amp; Monitoring<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Cardiovascular System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department with crushing, substernal chest pain that radiates to his left arm.

Patients with diabetes are more likely to have coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. These patients are more likely to have multivessel disease and episodes of silent ischemia compared to non-diabetics. Revascularization is recommended in patients that are considered high-risk. The main indications for CABG include three-vessel disease with greater than 70 percent stenosis, left main coronary disease with greater than 50 percent stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction. For most patients with diabetes and multivessel disease, CABG is preferred over percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting due to better outcomes.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Balloon angioplasty, otherwise known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), is a non-surgical alternative to coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Balloon angioplasty is not the best option due to complications. Acute and subacute closure and restenosis are the most significant problems seen in patients with balloon stenting. Furthermore, patients with multivessel disease have shown reduced survival rates compared to those who received coronary artery bypass surgery.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Bare metal coronary artery stents are used in percutaneous coronary intervention to treat stable and unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and multivessel disease. Although mortality is not significantly different, bare metal stents have a higher rate of repeat revascularization due to restenosis. Thus, bare metal stenting is the not the best option in a patient with multivessel disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Drug-eluting stents are coated with an antiproliferative drug, which allows drug elution into the coronary wall for weeks after stent implantation. Drug-eluting stents were developed to reduce restenosis rates that were seen in bare metal stents. Complications include stent thrombosis. In addition, drug-eluting stents had a higher rate of target lesion revascularization in diabetics. Furthermore, most studies have shown that event-free survival is worse after revascularization with percutaneous cutaneous intervention in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Medical therapy is indicated in patients with short-term risk of death or low probability of recurrent myocardial infarction. For those with recurrent angina or evidence of ischemic disease on stress testing, invasive therapy is more appropriate. This is a high-risk patient who presents with lesions on coronary angiography, therefore, revascularization is indicated.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease who require revascularization.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://ezproxy.pcom.edu:2059/contents/coronary-artery-revascularization-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus-and-multivessel-coronary-artery-disease?source=search_result&amp;search=cabg+diabetes&amp;selectedTitle=1%7E150#H32 " target="_search">CABG on Uptodate</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/12/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>97 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x?source=search_result&amp;search=The+metabolic+syndrome+%28insulin+resistance+syndrome+or+syndrome+X%29&amp;selectedTitle=1~150" target="_search">"The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)" on UpToDate.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Disease Detection &amp; Monitoring<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Scientific Understanding of Health &amp; Disease Mechanisms<br>Body System: Endocrine System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 53-year-old male presents to the office for a physical examination and age-appropriate screening labs.

Most cases are associated with overuse. Patients present with pain on thumb and wrist movement with focal tenderness over the radial styloid which is along the radial border of the hand. The abductor pollicis longs and extensor pollicis brevis are typically involved. The Finkelstein's test is provocative test for the diagnosis of the disease. Sharp pain is elicited along the distal radius by downward deflection of the thumb and ulnar bone. Plain films are non-diagnostic but may show soft-tissue swelling over the radial styloid. Focal abnormalities such as cortical erosion, sclerosis or periosteal reaction may be seen.<br> <br> Due to compensations that develop secondary to pain in the APL or EPB muscles, you often see counterstain points arise around the elbow as the compensating muscles become overworked and irritated.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Carpal tunnel syndrome is due to median nerve entrapment at the flexor retinaculum and patients are often unable to grip normally and cannot oppose the thumb and index finger normally. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms are typically felt in the thumb through 4th finger. Over time, patients can develop muscle atrophy of the thenar eminence. The most common presentation is numbness and tingling over the first three digits of the hand. Pain is usually worst at night. Phalen's maneuver and Tinel's sign can reproduce the patient's symptoms. However, the Finkelstein's test is diagnostic for De Quervain tenosynovitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Cubital tunnel syndrome is caused by ulnar nerve entrapment at the medial edge of the elbow. Cubital tunnel syndrome presents with similar symptoms of Guyon's canal syndrome. Symptoms include tingling and/or pain along the 4th and 5th digits of the corresponding hand. Altered sensation in these fingers may also be reported. Muscle wasting of the hypothenar eminence may be noted on physical examination. Although, cubital tunnel syndrome and Guyon's canal syndrome are both types of ulnar neuropathy, cubital tunnel syndrome is less likely in this patient. This patient denies pain in the elbow or history of trauma to the area. In addition, the Finkelstein's test is diagnostic for De Quervain tenosynovitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Cervical disc disease can cause referred pain to the shoulder, neck and or back. Examination of the cervical spine should be included in all evaluations of back, shoulder and or neck pain. Patients often complain of pain that started in the neck area. Pain that radiates down the arms passed the elbow is suggestive of cervical disc disorder. The Spurling's test is used in the evaluation of a patient with these complaints. Reproduction of the pain with extension and rotation of the cervical spine with axial loading is highly suggestive of the disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The ulnar nerve is the terminal branch of the brachial plexus. It is responsible for innervation to the muscles of the forearm and hand. It also is responsible for sensation to the 4th and 5th digits. Ulnar nerve entrapment at Guyon's canal may cause denervation and/or paralysis of the muscles. Anatomically, the ulnar nerve is entrapped as it passes through the tunnel formed by the pisiform and hamate bones and the pisohamate ligament at the level of the wrist. This produces atrophy of the hypothenar eminence and impairs both adduction and abduction of the 4th and 5th fingers. Muscle wasting of these digits may occur but is rare. Usually patients also complain of a “pins and needles” sensation of the 5th digit and the medial aspect of the palmar surface of the 4th digit. Physical examination will be evident for sensory loss along the ulnar distribution in the hand with preservation in the dorsal aspect of the hand.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>De Quervain tenosynovitis is inflammation of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A1243387-business.html#overview" target="_search">De Quervains on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 11/30/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>99 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Osteopathic Principle and Practice<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 26-year old left-handed female with no significant past medical history presents with neck pain over the last few weeks.

The majority of thoracic MET involves direct post-isometric relaxation. In this type of MET, the physician instructs the patient to isometrically contract the agonist muscle. Immediately following an isometric contraction, the neuromuscular apparatus is in a refractory state during which enhanced passive stretching may be performed. The physician may take up the myofascial slack during this relaxed refractory period.<br><br>Upper thoracic somatic dysfunctions (T1-T4) use the head and neck as a lever to induce motion at the segment; lower thoracic somatic dysfunctions (T5-T12) use the trunk as a lever. On physical exam, this patient has a T4 FS<sub>R</sub>R<sub>R</sub>; at T4, there is a restriction in extension, left sidebending, and left rotation. With the patient seated, the physician monitors the T4-T5 interspace with one hand. With the other hand, the physician uses the patient’s head and neck as a lever to induce extension, left sidebending, and left rotation until the edge of the restrictive barrier is reached at T4. The patient is instructed to flex the head and neck and turn right while the physician provides an unyielding counterforce. The isometric contraction provided by the patient is maintained for 3 to 5 seconds and then the patient is to stop and relax. When the patient is relaxed, the physician will reposition the head and neck in order to engage the edge of the new restrictive barriers in extension, left sidebending, and left rotation. The series of isometric contraction, relaxation, and re-positioning is repeated 3 to 5 times or until motion is improved at T4.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This is the patient's position of ease.

WPW is a type of AV junction disorder that can lead to atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). AVRT results when there is a circular movement of an impulse between the AV node and the atrium through a bypass tract, known as the bundle of Kent. Patients can present with palpitations, shortness of breath, angina, syncope or lightheadedness. Treatment may consist of carotid massage, the Valsalva maneuver, adenosine and cardioversion if the patient is unstable. WPW may also be known as pre-excitation syndrome. As a result of the bypass tract, the ventricles begin to partially depolarize earlier which gives rise to the characteristic initial slurring of the QRS complex, also known as a delta wave. Treatment may also consist of class IA or class III antiarrhythmics.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease with a characteristic EKG pattern and can be a cause of sudden cardiac death.  The pattern seen on the ECG is persistent ST elevations in the electrocardiographic leadsV1-V3 with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) appearance with or without the terminal S waves in the lateral leads that are associated with a typical RBBB.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> J waves are associated with hypothermia.  A j wave, also known as an Osborn wave, is a positive deflection occurring at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment.  J waves are typically associated with hypothermia but may also be seen in patients with hypercalcemia, brain injury, vasospastic angina and ventricular fibrillation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is a type of second degree heart block.

Vital signs are unremarkable. Physical examination reveals a very thin malnourished child younger than stated age. He is able to speak appropriately but is unable to stand and walk. There is visible deformity of the wrists noted. You note paravertebral hypertonicity that is reportedly tender to palpation from T1-4.&nbsp; Radiographs of the lower extremities and wrists are obtained, as seen in the exhibit. Which of the following represent the most likely laboratory findings in this patient?</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">decreased alkaline phosphatase, decreased PTH, decreased serum phosphate</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">elevated alkaline phosphatase, decreased PTH, decreased serum phosphate</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated PTH, decreased serum phosphate</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated PTH, elevated serum phosphate</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">elevated alkaline phosphatase, normal PTH, decreased serum phosphate</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>This patient is most likely suffering from nutritional rickets. Nutritional rickets will show decreased to normal levels of serum calcium, decreased serum phosphate, elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Nutritional rickets is due to a dietary deficiency of vitamin D (most common) or calcium. Exhibit A demonstrates key radiographic findings of nutritional rickets, mainly bowing of long bones as well as cupping and fraying of the metaphyseal region in the wrist.<br> <br> This patient is exhibiting TART changes from T1-4 which can represent a variety of different pathologies and affected tissues.&nbsp; In this case, the viscerosomatic reflex is in response to the skeletal and endocrine changes taking place in the upper extremities and the parathyroid glands.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Primary hypophosphatemia is the most common cause of non-nutritional rickets. Hypophosphatemia is also seen in refeeding syndrome and respiratory alkalosis. In primary hypophosphatemia, lab results will show decreased serum calcium, low serum phosphate, elevated (not decreased) alkaline phosphatase, as well as increased PTH.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The different causes of rickets can either present with decreased or normal levels of calcium. When calcium levels are low, PTH levels become elevated which allow the activation of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, thus allowing the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol). Therefore, PTH levels will always be elevated with rickets.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Elevated serum phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia) normally result in increased levels of PTH, which leads to increased phosphate excretion by the kidneys into the urine. Concurrently, calcium levels are usually decreased due to precipitation of calcium and phosphate into tissues. As a result of low serum calcium levels, as mentioned previously, this also will lead to increased PTH levels.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Hypophosphatemic rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a dominant X-linked disorder characterized by the inability for the proximal tubules of the kidney to reabsorb phosphate due to a mutation in the PHEX gene. It is currently theorized that PHEX protects the extracellular matrix glycoproteins from proteolysis. It is associated with decreased serum phosphate, elevated alkaline phosphatase, normal PTH, and normal serum calcium.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Nutritional rickets will present with an elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated PTH, and decreased phosphate.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>The key differentiating laboratory component of nutritional from X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is an elevated parathyroid hormone.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/985510-overview" target="_search">"Rickets" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 11/30/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>104 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/177632-overview" target="_search">"Hepatitis B" on Medscape</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Abnormal Findings<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Hepatobiliary System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; ">For each numbered item (patient presentation), select the one heading (serologic hepatitis B marker) most closely associated with it.

She has no complaints and states she has been in good health this year. Patient history is positive for hepatitis B infection.

Patients with immune tolerant HBV have positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Anti-HBc IgG titers. The HBe antigen or antibody can be positive or negative in these patients. This is a typical presentation of a person born in a hepatitis B-endemic area, such as Southeast Asia or Africa. In this patient, HBV was most likely acquired perinatally. As long as these patients maintain normal aminotransferase levels, they are considered low-risk for progression of the disease. However, as she ages she is at increased risk for progression of the disease. Therefore, aminotransferases should be monitored. If the levels of aminotransferases increase, then the patient should receive a liver biopsy and treatment.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Isolated antibodies to the core antigen, with no other positive serology, is the hallmark of the window period. The window period is the point at which the assays cannot yet detect the hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e surface antigen in the blood. The window period is typically six months after infection of the disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A positive titer of anti-HBs can indicate previous immunization, as well as those who have recovered from an actual hepatitis B infection. Anti-HBs represents the production of antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. However, a positive titer of anti-HBs can indicate previous immunization, as well as those who have recovered from an actual hepatitis B infection. To differentiate between the two diagnosis, one should check the level of anti-HBc (IgG). Anti-HBc is antibodies produced in reaction to the core antigen of the virus. A positive anti-HBc (IgG) level, in conjunction with a positive anti-HBs titer, indicate a resolved hepatitis B viral infection.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Patients with only a positive anti-HBs titer have been previously immunization to the hepatitis B virus. Vaccination against the hepatitis B virus initiates the production of antibodies against HBsAg. These antibodies, which are labeled as Anti-HBs, confer passive immunity to the virus. However, a positive titer of anti-HBs can indicate previous immunization, as well as those who have recovered from an actual hepatitis B infection. To differentiate between the two diagnosis, one should check the level of anti-HBc (IgG). Anti--HBc is antibodies produced in reaction to the core antigen of the virus. A positive anti-HBc (IgG) level in conjunction with a positive anti-HBs titer indicate a resolved hepatitis B viral infection.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This serology is consistent with acute, active infection. Patients with acute, active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection present with elevated aminotransaminase. Viral markers that can be identified in the serum to support an acute diagnosis include the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). IgM antibodies to the core antigen also support that the infection is acute.

Patients with an acute MI may present with chest pain, tightness or pressure, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. Female patients are more likely to have an atypical presentation with nausea, light-headedness, and anxiety. An ECG can indicate the location of the MI.

The pain is worse in the morning upon waking up from sleep. On review of symptoms, the patient reports occasional earaches with restriction associated with eating. She describes the pain as sharp, radiating down the face and bilateral. She denies any major trauma or recent infection. &nbsp;She denies any similar episodes in the past. She states that she is otherwise healthy and runs 1 mile every day. Physical examination is remarkable for chin deviation towards the side of the pain. She states she has not tried any medication for the pain as it is mostly intermittent in nature and usually resolves on its own. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute otitis media</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">trigeminal neuralgia</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">temporal arteritis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">temporomandibular joint syndrome</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">tension headache</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a synovial joint that connects the jaw to either side of the skull. The etiology of TMJ dysfunction is multifactorial but most cases are linked to anterior displacement of the joint. TMJ dysfunction is a common problem and is a frequent cause of toothache and facial pain. Patients typically complain of pain that is periauricular and is exacerbated by chewing. Patients may complain of headaches, neck pain, and jaw soreness with audible "clicking" when opening or closing the jaw. The physical examination may be evident for lateral tracking of the jaw on opening or closing. Restricted range of motion of the jaw may also be noted. Patients usually report tenderness at the joint and may have palpable crepitus or clicking when opening or closing her jaw on examination. Conservative measures are the mainstay of treatment for TMJ dysfunction.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction. Patients complain of ear pain. Fever may or may not be present. Most patients report recent history of an upper respiratory infection. Physical examination is evident for visible inflammation and effusion of the eardrum with signs of fullness, bulging, cloudiness and redness behind the ear. This patient presents with deviation of the mandible on physical examination, therefore otitis media is not likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Trigeminal neuralgia pain is usually unilatral and is described as "shock like", lancinating unbearable pain. It is not made worse with chewing and does not cause deviation of the jaw.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Temporal arteritis, or giant cell arteritis, is a systemic inflammatory vasculitis. Infiltration of inflammatory cells causes mural thickening leading to luminal narrowing and distal ischemia. Patients present with headache, jaw pain, visual disturbances and scalp tenderness. If not treated, temporal arteritis can lead to permanent vision loss. Although temporal arteritis should be considered in this patient, her physical examination points towards a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Tension headache is a common cause of recurring headaches that is precipitated by muscular and psychogenic factors. Most patients with tension headaches admit to a large amount of daily stress. This stress is thought to cause muscle contraction of the scalp and neck muscles. Other causes include depression and poor posture. Patients with tension headaches describe a non-pulsatile type of head pain that wraps around their head in a band like distribution. Physical examination may be normal but tight cervical muscles may be appreciated. This patient presents with unilateral pain that is exacerbated by chewing with evidence of jaw deviation on physical examination, therefore tension headache is unlikely.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Temporomandibular joint syndrome is a common cause of headache with ear pain and jaw soreness.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com /article/809598-overview." target="_search">Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/30/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>116 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241381-treatment" target="_search">"Hypertension Treatment and Management" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Disease Detection &amp; Monitoring<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Cardiovascular System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 54-year-old male presents to the office for an annual examination.&nbsp; History reveals he has a twenty-pack year smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. &nbsp;Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 162/84 mmHg.&nbsp;His BMI is 28. &nbsp;Baseline laboratory analysis shows a blood creatinine test 1.5 milligrams per deciliter, a fasting blood glucose of 110 milligrams per deciliter with an albumin to creatinine ration of 115 milligrams per gram.&nbsp;The patient is counseled on the importance of lifestyle changes and dietary modifications and is seen in the office again for a follow-up.&nbsp; His blood pressure is 164/82 mmHg at the second visit.

Hypertension is defined as a systolic pressure over 140 mmHG or a diastolic pressure over 90 mmHg. It is usually asymptomatic, unless it has begun to cause end organ damage. The choices provided are all used in the treatment of hypertension. The key to answering hypertension questions will be to look for the existence of co-morbidity such as diabetes or COPD that will make a medication either preferred or contraindicated. In this case, this patient presents with an elevated creatinine and proteinuria, therefore first line treatment for elevated blood pressure is an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). &nbsp;Lisinopril is an ACE-inhibitor and is quite effective in lowering blood pressure. ACE-inhibitors would be the choice in a patient who is hypertensive and also has evidence of chronic kidney disease, as they protect kidney function and lower cardiovascular risk. They are also agents to add in congestive heart failure because they lower mortality.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> According to the Eighth Joint National Committee, goal blood pressure is adult's ages 18-59 is less than 140/90 mmHg. Therefore, this patient<br>

presents with elevated blood pressure and needs to be started on a hypertensive agent. The first line agent in treating hypertension in the general non-black population without evidence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease can include an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Isosorbide mononitrate is a vasodilator. The drug stimulates cGMP production, resulting in vascular smooth muscle relaxation. According to the<br>

Eighth Joint National Committee 8, use of nitrates should not be considered first line treatment of adult hypertension.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that is also used to lower blood pressure. The indication for beta-blockers is in congestive heart failure and in patients who are post myocardial infarction, where they will reduce mortality. They are also relatively contraindicated in patients with COPD or asthma, as they will exacerbate the pulmonary symptoms. Medications that lower mortality are crucial to remember. Look for relative contraindications and co-morbidity to select the drug of choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic that is hardly ever used as a diuretic. It is used in congestive heart failure because of its antagonistic effects on aldosterone. Its other major use is as an anti-androgen, as it is a potent inhibitor of the androgen receptors and an inhibitor of androgen production. In patients who develop gynecomastia while taking spironolactone, eplerenone is the alternative.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used&nbsp;in hypertensive patients with evidence of proteinuria and chronic kidney disease.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/241381-treatment" target="_search">"Hypertension Treatment and Management" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/11/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>117 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: History &amp; Physical Examination<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Osteopathic Principle and Practice<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A <span class="Highlight">25</span>-year-old G2P2 female presents to the office complaining of low back pain. History reveals she had a spontaneous vaginal delivery two weeks ago. The pain is described as achy, and worse with prolonged sitting. She has tried over the counter pain medicine without relief. She denies saddle anesthesia, bladder incontinence, and focal weakness of the lower extremities. She has no history of IV drug use or known malignancy. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 98.6 F, a blood pressure of 122/81 mmHg, a heart rate of 65/min, a respiratory rate of 16/min, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical exam reveals 5/5 strength of the lower extremities bilaterally. Two point discrimination and pinprick sensation is intact bilaterally.

The patient typically has direct tenderness at the lumbosacral junction and the inferior lateral angles. With both bilateral sacral flexion and bilateral sacral extension, the sacrum rotates about a middle transverse axis. With sacral flexion, the sacral sulci are rotated forward or anterior. Consequently, the patient has deep sacral sulci and her inferior lateral angles are shallow and posterior. The lumbosacral spring test is only positive if the sacral base has moved posteriorly. Additionally, since both SI joints are restricted, asymmetry at the sacral base cannot be appreciated and the patient has a falsely negative seated flexion test.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The findings of bilateral sacral extension are opposite those of bilateral sacral flexion. The seated flexion test is still negative, but the lumbosacral spring test is positive. Additionally, the patient has shallow or posterior sacral sulci and her inferior lateral angles are deep or anterior.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> With left on right rotation, there is a positive seated flexion test on the left and a positive lumbosacral spring test. The left sulcus is shallow and the right inferior lateral angle is anterior (deep) and superior. With right on left rotation, there is a positive seated flexion test on the right and a positive lumbosacral spring test. The right sulcus is shallow and the left inferior lateral angle is anterior (deep) and superior.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Bilateral sacral flexion produces a false negative seated flexion test. A deep sacral base is evidence of dysfunction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This is an example of forward sacral torsion. There is a positive seated flexion test on the left and a negative lumbosacral spring test.

CML involves clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells. A leukocytosis with excess granulocytes and basophils may be seen. CML involves a BCR-ABL t(9;22) translocation which forms the classic Philadelphia chromosome. CML if often diagnosed with routine testing while many patients are asymptomatic. Patients may present with anemia, splenomegaly, LUQ pain, early satiety and constitutional symptoms. There are three phases of CML including chronic, accelerated and blast phases. CBC analysis in patients with CML usually shows a very high WBC, sometimes greater than 500,000 and signs of anemia. Other abnormal labs include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and high LDH, uric acid and B12 levels. Treatment for chronic CML is imatinib or allogenic stem cell transplant while the treatment for the blast phase of CML is dasatinib or stem cell transplant. Below is the appearance of a typical blood smear in patients with CML.<br> <br> <img src="HTTPS://d2vrujxrqm3l5p.cloudfront.net/c87d0a07-f65c-4577-a32b-a5552e7b1e93.png" alt=""><br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> CLL is a malignant clonal proliferation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes.  This is the most common type of leukemia and is commonly a diagnosis of elderly males.  Most cases of CLL involve well differentiated B lymphocytes, although a very rare T cell type of CLL has been described.  First degree relatives of patients with CLL are three times more likely to develop the disorder.  CLL is often asymptomatic but many patients may present with infection, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.  CBC usually shows an abundance of small, normal appearing lymphocytes and ruptured smudge cells on peripheral smear.  Bone marrow biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis or staging but may provide prognostic information and help assess response to therapy.  Treatment is usually withheld until the patient becomes symptomatic.  When symptomatic, CLL is treated with chemotherapy and radiation.  The Rai staging system is commonly used for CLL which correlates with survival.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Hairy cell leukemia is a malignant disorder of well differentiated B lymphocytes.  It is a rare disease that accounts for less than 2% of adult leukemia cases which usually affects the elderly male population.  HCL often presents with splenomegaly, weakness, fatigue, petechiae, abdominal pain, early satiety and weight loss.  Symptoms are similar to those seen in patients with CLL except that HCL patients rarely have lymphadenopathy.  HCL is diagnosed based on history, physical exam and labs but the diagnosis is confirmed through the identification of hairy cells in the blood, blood marrow or spleen.  TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) stain and flow cytometry are helpful in distinguishing the pathognomonic hairy cells.  Peripheral smear shows hairy cells, also described as mononuclear cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and cytoplasmic projections.  Ten percent of patients with HCL will never require treatment as they have a benign disease course.  However, treatment should begin when patients become symptomatic or cytopenic.  Nucleoside analogs are the initial treatment of choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Hodgkin disease is predominately a B-cell malignancy. It may have an association with EBV. It usually presents in the third decade or sixth decade. Nodular sclerosing type is the most common type in patients in their thirties while lymphocyte depleted type is more common in patients in their sixties. HD usually presents with cervical adenopathy but it may also present with a mediastinal mass. Early in its presentation it is present above the diaphragm with infradiaphragmatic involvement suggesting more disseminated disease. Other presenting signs include systemic symptoms, pruritus and hepatosplenomegaly. Pel-ebstein fevers and alcohol induced nodal pain are rare but specific signs of Hodgkin disease. Diagnosis of HD is best made with excisional lymph node biopsy because fine-needle biopsy is usually non-diagnostic. Histology is considered positive when Reed-Sternberg cells are observed which are abnormal giant cells with bilobar nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli. The most common subtype of HD is nodular sclerosing type.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Multiple myeloma is due to a clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells with excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments.  It is mainly a disease of the elderly population and has a peak incidence in the seventh decade.  It usually presents with signs of anemia, bone pain, lytic bone lesions, signs of hypercalcemia such as poyluria, constipation and confusion.  The classic triad for MM is greater than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, M proteins in the urine and evidence of lytic bone lesions.  Because multiple myeloma is an osteoclastic process, a bone scan which detects osteoblastic activity, may be negative.  MM treatment consists of chemotherapy, often with melphalan and prednisone.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>CML involves clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells.

CML involves clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells. A leukocytosis with excess granulocytes and basophils may be seen. CML involves a BCR-ABL t(9;22) translocation which forms the classic Philadelphia chromosome. CML if often diagnosed with routine testing while many patients are asymptomatic. Patients may present with anemia, splenomegaly, LUQ pain, early satiety and constitutional symptoms. There are three phases of CML including chronic, accelerated and blast phases. CBC analysis in patients with CML usually shows a very high WBC, sometimes greater than 500,000 and signs of anemia. Other abnormal labs include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and high LDH, uric acid and B12 levels. Treatment for chronic CML is imatinib or allogenic stem cell transplant while the treatment for the blast phase of CML is dasatinib or stem cell transplant.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein receptor IIb/IIIa on activated platelets thereby preventing platelet aggregation.  It is used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and PCTA.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Busulfan is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of CML.

Nursing has been having a hard time establishing a second IV after multiple attempts. &nbsp;Anesthesia evaluates the patient and determine that he should not be difficult to extubate after surgery but does need an additional IV line. The patient is given the option and consents to a subclavian central line for venous access instead continuing peripheral IV attempts. Although the patient was told about the chance of several complications associated with the procedure, he was not informed of the possibility of iatrogenic pneumothorax. The patient unfortunately gets a pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and is not able to be extubated after surgery. He remained intubated for 7 days and was extubated after his pneumothorax resolved and his chest tube was withdrawn. The patient files suit against the physician. The most likely outcome is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient wins the case because nursing failed to obtained IV access resulting in an unnecessary procedure</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient wins the case because the risk of pneumothorax was not discussed with the patient</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the physician wins and was not found negligent for causing a pneumothorax as this is a common possible complication from this procedure</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the physician wins the case because the pneumothorax is a rare complication that the physician could not foresee happening</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the physician wins the case because the pneumothorax was recognized, treated and the patient survived to discharge</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>When obtaining consent for any procedure or medical treatment, it is important to discuss all potential complications and potential adverse outcomes. Although iatrogenic pneumothorax from central line placement is not common, it is a well-known possible complication. &nbsp;The pneumothorax resulted in a chest tube, prolong hospital stay and possible loss wages from being hospitalized for an additional week. The patient in this study had COPD and the risk of a pneumothorax has greater consequences than a healthier patient. Had he been told of this possible complication, he may have elected to have nursing continue to try to gain an additional peripheral IV line.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> While the patient would likely win this case, it is reasonable to place a central line in a patient that needs multiple IV lines and has failed multiple attempts of peripheral access.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> While this is a common complication of a subclavian central line placement, the patient still has the right to consent weather he would like the line placed or if he would like the alternative option of having nursing continue try to establish an additional peripheral IV line.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Pneumothorax is a well-known complication of central line placement. The risk of a pneumothorax is higher in a subclavian central line. An internal jugular central line has a slightly lower risk of pneumothorax and would possibly have been a better option than a subclavian central line. However, placement of central lines comes down to what the physician is comfortable placing, access to ultrasound, etc., and this physician would not have been faulted for placing a subclavian line when an internal jugular line still carries risk of pneumothorax.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The patient would still win because of this common complication was not given in the consent. Even though the patient was treated for the pneumothorax and survived he would still be able to sue the physician for the prolong hospitalization stay and for loss wages.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>When obtaining consent for a procedure, always make sure to disclose ALL potential major risks, not matter how unlikely you feel they may be.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>As the physician providing or performing the treatment and/or procedure (not a delegated representative), you should disclose and discuss with your patient: The patient's diagnosis, if known the nature and purpose of a proposed treatment or procedure, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment or procedure, alternatives (regardless of their cost or the extent to which the treatment options are covered by health insurance), the risks and benefits of the alternative treatment or procedure, and the risks and benefits of not receiving or undergoing a treatment or procedure.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/consent.html" target="_search">"Informed Consent" from the University of Washington School of Medicine</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/3/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>123 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/722857_4" target="_search">Achieving Toilet Continenance</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Physiologic Processes<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Health Promotion &amp; Disease Prevention<br>Body System: Asymptomatic &amp; General Symptoms<br>Discipline: Pediatrics<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A concerned mother brings her 18-month-old son to your office for evaluation.

Infant (less than 1 year old) or early toilet training is not directly comparable with late toilet training (children aged 18 months or over), since both the timing and expected outcome are different. In early toilet training, the goal is to learn when the child needs to void, so that he or she can be brought to the toilet, while the goal of late toilet training is for the child to be completely independent in the entire process of toileting. <br><br>In the United States, 26 percent of children achieve daytime continence by 24 months of age, 85 percent by 30 months, and 98 percent by 36 months of age.

Patients with this disorder usually present with esophageal dysphagia, voice changes, regurgitation of undigested food and bad breath (halitosis). Due to impaired food digestion, patients also frequently experience weight loss. Zenker's diverticulum occurs secondary to abnormal cricopharyngeal muscular activity that results in increased mucosal pressure. Since the weakest part of the mucosa is posterior, a pouch (diverticulum) forms and food gets lodged in this area.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Achalasia refers to the stricture of the esophagus due to failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. Patients with achalasia also present with dysphagia and regurgitation, but in addition to these symptoms, patients also experience heartburn and do not have halitosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Although Boerhaave's syndrome can also present with dysphagia of solid foods, the month-long history makes this diagnosis unlikely. Boerhaave's syndrome is rupture of the esophagus, usually due to prolonged retching.

Just like the stock market, you can also try to “hedge” your bets if you are unsure of the initial diagnosis.

Its intention is to open any suture that may be impacted or restricted in its normal range of motion. It is beneficial at the occipitomastoid&nbsp;suture between the occipital and temporal bones because of its effects on the vagus nerve. The occipital and temporal bones come together to form the jugular foramen. The vagus nerve originates in the medulla and exits the cranium through the jugular foramen. Dysfunction of the vagus nerve can occur secondary to a compression at the occipitomastoid&nbsp;suture. The vagus nerve is responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of many organ systems, including the heart.

Treatment options include a structured environment with psychotherapy.<br><br>According to the DSM 5, the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder include:<br><br>A. Disregard for and violation of others rights since age 15, as indicated by one of the seven sub features:<strong><br></strong>&nbsp; 1) Failure to obey laws and norms by engaging in behavior which results in criminal arrest, or would warrant criminal arrest<br>&nbsp; 2) Lying, deception, and manipulation, for profit tor self-amusement<br>&nbsp; 3) Impulsive behavior<br>&nbsp; 4) Irritability and aggression, manifested as frequently assaults others, or engages in fighting<br>&nbsp; 5) Blatantly disregards safety of self and others,<br>&nbsp; 6) A pattern of irresponsibility<br>&nbsp; 7) Lack of remorse for actions<br>
<p>B. The person is at least age 18</p>
<p>C. Conduct disorder was present by history before age 15</p>
<p>D. and the antisocial behavior does not occur in the context of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder</p>
<br><br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the fear of criticism and embarrassment, social withdrawal, and a preoccupation by fear of rejection.  Treatment options include psychotherapy (initially individualized and then followed by group therapy) combined with antidepressants or anxiolytics.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Borderline personality is characterized by unstable moods, high impulsivity, and self-destructive behavior.  Another key finding is splitting, seeing others as either all good or all bad.  They feel alone inside and have multiple suicide attempts over seemingly trivial things. Self-mutilation is another common finding in borderline patients.  Treatment options include extensive psychotherapy combined with low-dose antipsychotics, SSRIs, or mood stabilizers.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Although conduct disorder also presents in a similar manner, this diagnosis is reserved for minors, and at 19 years of age, this patient is considered an adult.  Conduct disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anti-social behavior including stealing, fighting, destroying property and forced sexual activity. It is more common in children with ADHD.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by the inability to form close relationships, social withdrawal, and lack of sexual interests. Typically, they are unable to show emotion and are happy to be alone (contrast this with avoidant personality disorder).  Treatment options include antipsychotics initially to resolve behavior as well as supportive psychotherapy.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Antisocial personality disorder is associated with criminal behavior. Look for patients who show disregard for others and engage in activities such as drugs, theft and assault. Remember that conduct disorder is basically the same thing in a minor (patient less than age 18).<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Sometimes there are only one or two clues that give an answer away.

Polymyositis is a progressive, systemic connective tissue disorder characterized by immune mediated muscle inflammation primarily affecting striated muscle fibers. It usually affects patients between the ages of 50-70 and affects females more than males. It may present with symmetric, progressive, proximal muscle weakness. Patients with polymyositis may develop myocarditis and cardiac conduction defects and their condition may be associated with an underlying malignancy, especially breast and lung carcinomas. Lab analysis reveals an increased serum creatine kinase, increased aldolase and positive anti-Jo-1 antibodies. A muscle biopsy reveals predominantly lymphocytic muscle infiltration with evidence of necrosis and regeneration.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that affects both the skin and muscles. It may also affect the joints. In the disease, antibodies form and attack the muscle capillaries and small arterioles. As the disease progresses, micro infarction occurs within the muscles. Skin disease is one of the initial presenting signs. Heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules are pathognomonic of the disease. Heliotrope rash is an erythematous rash involving the periorbital area. Gottron's papules are erythematous nodules palpated over the bony prominences. Muscle biopsy is similar to polymyositis in that is shows lymphocytic infiltration of the endomysium. However, cell markers in dermatomyositis are positive for CD4-positive cells.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder in which the thyroid cannot produce sufficient thyroid hormones. Classic symptoms include lethargy, weight gain, dry skin, cold intolerance, and constipation; however, signs and symptoms can be subtle. Neuromuscular and musculoskeletal complaints can occur in hypothyroidism. Patients report pain, stiffness and aches of the proximal muscles, which is similar to the complaints seen in patients with polymyositis. Distribution is symmetrical. Etiology of hypothyroid myopathy is caused by slowed muscle contraction due to impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Laboratory analysis in hypothyroid myositis is remarkable for elevated creatine kinase and abnormal thyroid function tests. Hypothyroid myopathy is an unlikely cause of muscle pain in this patient. Laboratory analysis reveals a normal thyroid-stimulating factor. In addition, muscle biopsy is suggestive of an inflammatory process. Therefore, a diagnosis of hypothyroid myopathy is not likely in his patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Inclusion body myositis is an insidious inflammatory muscle disorder that affects older patients. Patients develop proximal and distal muscle weakness. The disease follows a slow progressive course. Dysphagia is present in over half of the cases. Pathology of a muscle biopsy in inclusion body myositis is remarkable for vacuoles and filamentous inclusions. Inflammatory markers are present as well. Inclusion body myositis is an unlikely diagnosis in his patient based on muscle biopsy results. Also, this patient lacks symptoms of distal muscle involvement.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Scleroderma is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease marked by fibrosis. There are two types of scleroderma: limited and diffuse. Limited scleroderma, or CREST syndrome, affects the hands, arm and face. Diffuse scleroderma is characterized by organ involvement in addition to the skin. 90% of patients present with Raynaud's syndrome. Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma and have a high risk of lung disease. Anti-Scl-70 antibody, or anti-topoisomerase I, attacks the topoisomerase 1 antigen, which is responsible for links between DNA. It is approximately 96% specific for scleroderma. The sensitivity varies with cutaneous involvement. This patient does not have symptoms suggestive of scleroderma making the utility of this assay unhelpful.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Anti-Jo-1 antibody is specific in inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335925-overview" target="_search">Polymyositis on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>136 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics/patient-physician-relationship-topics/patient-confidentiality.page" target="_search">"Patient Confidentiality" from the American Medical Association.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: General Concepts<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Health Care Delivery Issues<br>Body System: Asymptomatic &amp; General Symptoms<br>Discipline: Obstetrics/Gynecology<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother requesting that she have a gynecological examination.

History reveals the pain has been intermittent over the past three weeks and she states it is much worse after eating. Past medical history reveals gastritis, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia, for which she is taking omeprazole and simvastatin. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 60/min, a respiratory rate of 12/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). Physical examination reveals an obese woman in no apparent distress. She has a tender right upper quadrant exam but without guarding or rebound tenderness, and a negative Murphy’s sign. There is no scleral icterus. Serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, and lipase are tested and results are within normal limits. A bedside ultrasound is obtained of her right upper quadrant as shown in the exhibit. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute cholecystitis</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">ascending cholangitis</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">choledocolithiasis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">cholelithiasis</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">gallstone pancreatitis</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>Cholelithiasis is the presence of gallstones within the gallbladder, which this patient has as demonstrated by the ultrasound image. She is at high risk given her age, sex, and body habitus to develop gallstones. Remember the memory tool "fat, female, forty, fertile, and flatulent". She has typical biliary colic given her right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain radiating to the right shoulder that is intermittent and worse after meals. Patients develop biliary colic due to contraction of the gallbladder due to cholecystokinin (CCK) release following a meal. The ultrasound image shows the liver surrounding a fluid filled, anechoic (dark) structure that is the gallbladder. Within this dark sac, there is a large round echogenic mass that represent a gallstone. Notice that the stone casts a dark shadow as the highly dense stone blocks the soundwaves from the ultrasound transducer. This patient has cholelithiasis without any evidence of acute cholecystitis given the lack of fever, normal bilirubin, and negative Murphy’s sign.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acute cholecystitis is the inflammatory and often infectious result of blockage of the cystic duct. Over time an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct results in obstruction, inflammation, and infection and causes symptoms of biliary colic. Cholecystitis is detected on physical exam by the presence of a fever, mild jaundice, Murphy’s sign, or any signs of peritonitis such as rebound or guarding. By history and physical exam alone, this patient is unlikely to have cholecystitis. Ultrasound findings in cholecystitis are pericholecystic fluid, a thickened gallbladder wall, gas within the gallbladder, or a positive sonographic Murphy’s sign (pain over sonographic compression of gallbladder).<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Ascending cholangitis is a bacterial infection of the biliary tree that usually occurs due to obstruction of the common bile duct (choledocolithiasis). These patients are generally ill appearing and may have Charcot’s triad: RUQ pain, jaundice, and fever. Reynolds’ pentad (Charcot’s triad plus septic shock and altered mental status) is present when systemic infection is present and suggests critical illness. This patient has no fever, jaundice, or other signs of sepsis to suggest ascending cholangitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Choledocolithiasis defines gallstones in the common bile duct (CBD). Symptoms can vary widely but are usually consistent with biliary colic. Ultrasound is somewhat useful in this condition to evaluate the size of the CBD, and is used in conjunction with laboratory tests such as elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels in diagnosis. This patient has obvious stones in the gallbladder but without elevation of serum bilirubin/transaminases, and symptoms more consistent with biliary colic.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Gallstone pancreatitis occurs when a gallstone becomes lodged in the pancreatic duct causing obstruction of outflow from the pancreas. This obstruction causes inflammation, infection, and clinical pancreatitis. Pancreatitis usually presents with searing epigastric pain that radiates to the back and is worse with food, especially fats and alcohol. Diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis begins with serum lipase which should be elevated (in this case it is normal). This patient is unlikely to have gallstone pancreatitis given her normal lipase level.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Cholelithiasis describes gallstones within the gallbladder and presents classically in an overweight female of childbearing age.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Hepatobiliary problems are commonly tested on Step 2.

Salmonella is primarily transmitted through contaminated food, such as undercooked chicken or fruits and vegetables. In 2009 (and again in fall of 2012) this organism was responsible for a major U.S. food-borne outbreak in peanut butter. In addition to contaminated food, Salmonella spp. can be transmitted from reptiles and amphibians, as it is part of the normal flora. Symptoms of non-typhi Salmonella include fever, diarrhea that can contain red blood cells and abdominal cramps 12-72 hours after infection. Salmonella typhi, which is not currently found endemically in the United States, is transmitted directly between people and causes constipation with bacteremia.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Escherichia coli are lactose-positive bacteria on MacConkey agar that do not produce hydrogen sulfide.  Strains of E. coli can cause different types of diarrhea, including watery diarrhea in travelers (enterotoxigenic E. coli - ETEC) or bloody diarrhea from contaminated food or water (enterohemorrhagic E. coli - EHEC, Enteroinvasive E. coli - EIEC).<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Proteus mirabilis is lactose-negative and produces hydrogen sulfide in culture, but is most commonly associated with urinary tract infections, not diarrhea. These bacteria produce high levels of urease, which alkalinizes the urine and can lead to struvite stone formation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a non-fermenting bacteria (including lactose), and also does not produce hydrogen sulfide.  P. aeruginosa causes many clinical manifestations including, pneumonia in cystic fibrosis patients, wound contamination in burn patients, hot tub folliculitis, otitis externa, and endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers (to name a few), but is not a common cause of diarrhea.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Shigella dysenteriae is lactose-negative but does not produce hydrogen sulfide. This lack of hydrogen sulfide is a major distinguishing factor between Salmonella and Shigella spp, particularly since both genera of bacteria can cause watery or bloody diarrhea. In addition, Shigella is more commonly found in children who attend daycare and patients in mental institutions.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Salmonella typhimurium are lactose-negative bacteria on MacConkey agar that produce hydrogen sulfide in culture.

Shigella is more virulent, needing only ten organisms to cause infections, and can invade the colon to produce bloody diarrhea and an immune response, as well as produce a toxin that inhibits protein synthesis and kills enterocytes.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Borrelia burgdorferi is a Gram-negative spirochete, and it is the cause of Lyme disease.  Patients with this infection should present with a Bulls-eye rash, but not diarrhea.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Leptospira is a Gram-negative, question-mark-shaped spirochete found in animal urine.

It is usually benign and associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin-resistance, such as diabetes, obesity, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. It can be a sign of underlying malignancy, and, in a non-obese patient, a work-up for GI adenocarcinoma is warranted. The pathophysiology of AN pertains to the excessive amounts of insulin which bind to insulin-like growth factor receptors on keratinocytes, leading to their overgrowth. Work-up for this patient should include hemoglobin A1C levels to rule out diabetes, plasma insulin levels (should be high) to look for insulin resistance, complete blood cell count to look for anemia (as clue to a GI cause), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel. There is no treatment for AN, except control of underlying conditions.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> These lab tests are used to determine if the patient suffers from Cushing’s syndrome. There are many causes of Cushing’s syndrome, including ACTH hypersecretion from a pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease), ectopic ATCH secretion from neoplasm, excessive adrenal secretion of cortisol (bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma), and iatrogenic from exogenous corticosteroid administration. The patient can present with central obesity, hypertension, thin skin with striae, moon facies, muscle wasting (especially extremities), and hirsutism. The above patient does not have any of these signs, except obesity. The first screening test is a 24-hour urinary free cortisol, which will be elevated, or a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (A.M. cortisol persistently elevated after overnight suppression). If late afternoon ACTH levels are elevated, Cushing’s disease or ectopic ATCH production is likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> These tests are used to determine if primary adrenal insufficiency (e.g., Addison’s disease) is a cause of her skin hyperpigmentation (remember there is no skin hyperpigmentation in secondary causes of adrenal insufficiency). There are no signs/symptoms in the question stem to suggest Addison’s disease as the underlying cause of her neck discoloration, e.g., hypotension, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, among others. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the ACTH stimulation test should not show a rise in cortisol and a random cortisol level should be &lt;20 ug/dL. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia can be seen on CMP.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> These lab tests are used to determine if the patient suffers from hyperaldosteronism secondary to adrenocortical hyperplasia or unilateral adrenal adenoma (Conn’s disease). The clinical picture above does not depict hyperaldosteronism. Signs/symptoms of hyperaldosteronism include hypertension (usually diastolic), headache, polyuria, and muscle weakness. Labs show hypokalemia and an increased aldosterone/plasma renin activity (&gt;30 = primary hyperaldosteronism). CT scan can reveal an adrenal mass.

Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. Pericarditis is characterized by chest pain that is constant and pleuritic in nature. It is characteristically exacerbated by lying flat and relieved by sitting and leaning forward. The pain this patient describes is more likely to be pericarditis than angina because of its constant nature (angina is typically exertional), its' worsening with lying flat, and its' lack of associated symptoms (shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea).  Pericarditis is often (but not always) preceded by an upper respiratory viral infection. Pericarditis is also associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, uremia, radiation, neoplasms, open heart surgery, post-MI Dressler's syndrome, and neoplasms. Classic ECG findings in pericarditis include diffuse ST elevation PR depression. The physical examination in acute pericarditis will be significant for a pericardial friction rub. The initial treatment of pericarditis is with NSAIDs. In cases of pericarditis due to an identifiable cause, management is focused upon the underlying disorder and, if necessary, drainage of an associated pericardial effusion.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Aspirin therapy in combination with colchicine is used in patient with pericarditis after an acute myocardial infarction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Corticosteroids are not the first line of treatment for acute viral pericarditis. Initial management with systemic glucocorticoid therapy should be restricted to patients with pericarditis due to connective tissue disease, immune-mediated pericarditis, uremic pericarditis not responding to dialysis, and to patients who have contraindications to NSAID therapy.

This is endemic in Mexico thus be aware for patients who have recently traveled there or are immigrants from the region. Entamoeba histolytica has two forms, a cyst form and a trophozoite form. The disease is spread via the cyst form, which infects the colon and divides into eight trophozoites. This leads to ulcer formation in the colon causing bloody diarrhea. The trophozoites are motile; therefore, they have the propensity to enter into the portal vein. From here, they may seed onto the liver causing the formation of a hepatic abscess. Diagnosis can be made by ova and parasite analysis of a stool sample. Imaging of the liver will reveal a hepatic abscess if the infection has seeded onto the liver. The treatment of choice is metronidazole.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Osteopathic pearl</strong>: A Chapman point represents the somatic manifestation of a visceral dysfunction.

The son states that the patient lives at home with the son and the son's wife and two children. The son desires to keep the patient at home with the rest of his family as long as possible because the entire family enjoys spending time together and the two children enjoy spending time at home after school with their grandfather. However, the son describes to you, that due to the progressive nature of his father's dementia, more and more time is needed during the day to care for the patient and the son is now starting to miss workdays.

Changing the environment or removing dementia patients from settings, which they are familiar, can potentially exacerbate dementia symptoms. Thus, a home health aid would be ideal to provide this patient's son with the assistance he needs during the day and would still enable the patient to live at home with his family. An appropriate alternative to home health care would be an adult day care center;&nbsp;however, this would require removing the patient from his familiar setting and placing him in a new setting.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This patient is not suffering from an acute illness that requires a hospital admission. He has already been diagnosed with dementia and active family support.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Nursing Home Facility placement is indicated for patients that require constant, 24-hour skilled nursing supervision and is most appropriate for patients that are bed-bound or suffer from severe cognitive impairments due to advanced dementia or mental illness. The 24-hour skilled nursing care provided at a Nursing Home Facility is not indicated for this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Assisted Living Facility placement is most appropriate when the patient needs assistance with performing his/her basic ADLs such as administration of medication, supervision due to behavioral problems, and/or food preparation, but is unable to receive this care in their own home. Oftentimes this option is ideal for patients that do not have family or resources that would enable them to stay in their own home and thus must move to an assisted living facility for patient safety.

When the patient is unable to speak for him/herself, and the family cannot be reached, consent is assumed and treatment should begin without delay. The only situation in which this would not apply is if there is a prior DNR order in the chart and the patient is in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) is an act of the United States Congress, which was passed in 1986. It requires hospitals that accept Medicare to provide emergency health care treatment to any person regardless of citizenship, legal status or ability to pay. Hospitals that participate in this act may not transfer or discharge patients needing emergency treatment until considered stable. The act goes on to define conditions that require emergency treatment as those that are manifesting acute symptoms of severity that will jeopardize the patients health if medical attention is not given. Prenatal care is not considered a medical emergency according to EMTALA.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acute left-sided weakness is suggestive of a new onset stroke.

Osteomyelitis is a bone or bone marrow infection. In children it is usually caused from hematogenous seeding whereas in adults it is usually caused from direct spreading from a soft tissue infection or direct inoculation from penetrating trauma. It usually presents with localized bone pain and tenderness in addition to swelling, redness, and increased warmth. Laboratory analysis usually reveals an increased white blood cell count, elevated sedimentation rate, positive blood cultures, and elevated C reactive protein levels. The most common overall cause of osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus. Intravenous drug abusers are common infected with S. aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas is also the most common cause of osteomyelitis resulting from a foot puncture wound. Patients with sickle-cell disease are often infected with Salmonella. Osteomyelitis is most effectively treated with surgical debridement of necrotic, infected bone tissue followed by 4-6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics.&nbsp; As with any other pathology in the lower extremity, in this case we see TART changes from T11-L2 that are representative of a viscerosomatic reflex from the leg pathology.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cellulitis is an acute painful spreading infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. It causes warm, erythematous, and swollen tissues but does not lead to bone pain.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cutaneous anthrax presents 1-7 days after being exposed to spores of anthrax. It presents with an itchy papule that evolves into a black eschar.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Erysipelas resembles cellulitis however it is typically bright red with a peau d' orange appearance. It classically presents on the cheeks but can occur on other body regions. The borders are typically raised and well demarcated.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani and may be caused by puncture wounds. However it usually presents with muscle rigidity at the site of infection. It will occur in individuals who have not been properly immunized.

The most common causes are trauma, presence of a foreign body or prosthesis and/or bacteremia. A bone biopsy is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis by isolation of the pathogens from the bone lesion. The biopsy should be obtained prior to or within 48 hours of antibiotic therapy to be diagnostic. Histologic findings of acute osteomyelitis include edema, acute inflammatory cells, and small-vessel thrombosis with compromise of surrounding soft tissue. Histology of chronic osteomyelitis includes evidence of necrotic bone, presence of inflammatory cells and the formation of new bone.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Labs in patients with acute osteomyelitis usually show an increased white blood cell count, elevated sedimentation rate, and elevated CRP levels.  CRP can be used to monitor the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures are only positive 50% of the cases of osteomyelitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Imaging studies are useful in the presentation of osteomyelitis. Computed tomography (CT) may assist the clinician in the assessment of osteomyelitis through the detection of bony abnormalities or necrotic bone and/or soft tissue.

There are five types of meningitis including viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic and non-infectious.  Most commonly seen is viral meningitis which is rarely fatal in patients with healthy immune systems.  This patient states that her headache is worse with sitting, which causes flexion of the hips.  This position pulls down on the inflamed meninges and can worsen the headache.  Sudden onset of symptoms with the addition of fever make the other options less likely.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Classic migraines are preceded by an aura approximately ten to thirty minutes prior to the onset of the headache.  Auras include phenomena such as visual disturbances including flashing lights, spots or shapes.  Auras can also include tactile sensations such as pins and needles or difficulty speaking.  Patients with migraines usually have photophobia and the peak prevalence is in women ages thirty-five to forty-five.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Although this patient's symptoms could all be caused by influenza virus, typically influenza presents with dry cough, nasal congestion and diffuse myalgias. It rarely causes severe headaches as described in this case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a ruptured berry aneurysm.  This is usually seen in patients over the age of forty.  Other causes include arteriovenous malformations and head trauma.  Patients will usually describe SAH as "the worst headache of their life."  Other clinical symptoms to look for include new onset diplopia, transient loss of consciousness and pain reaching maximal intensity within one hour.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Tension headaches are described as bilateral, tight, band-like distribution of pain across the front of the head.

Review of symptoms is positive for neck pain, difficulty concentrating and low back pain. The patient was in a motor vehicle accident 1 week ago. He denies focal weakness, numbness, ringing in his ears, or vision changes. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 36.7ºC (98.0ºF), blood pressure of 124/74 mmHg, a heart rate of 89/min and a respiratory rate of 18/min.

This patient presents with neurological symptoms of dizziness, mental cloudiness and a positive Romberg test on physical examination. The Romberg test is a test for ataxia and proprioceptive loss in which the patient stands with his or her feet together and eyes closed. If the patient sways or loses balance, this is a positive test. A positive Romberg test supports the diagnosis of ataxia but is not localizing. Presence of a subdural hematoma is a consideration in a patient with recent head or neck trauma with cognitive symptoms. A subdural hematoma is common after a minor injury to the cervical spine or head. It develops slowly over days to weeks as the disrupted bridging veins between the brain parenchyma and dura bleed into the space. A CT scan of the head without contrast is the diagnostic tool of choice for acute head trauma.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Broad spectrum antibiotics are the appropriate therapy for bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is an inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The classic triad of bacterial meningitis is high fever (&gt;38°C), nuchal rigidity and change in mental status. However, patients are typically quite ill and therefore present soon after symptom onset. Although this may be likely in a young patient with neck pain, the absence of fever and the patient’s history of less acute onset of the disease make it a less likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Cyclobenzaprine is a muscle relaxant that could be utilized in the treatment of muscle spasms causing neck and back pain. However, the patient reports mental cloudiness and dizziness after suffering trauma to his head. This patient also has a positive Romberg test on physical examination. These neurologic abnormalities are concerning for intracranial pathology. A muscle relaxant should not be administered at this time. Although it would address the patient's complaints of neck and back pain, this medication would exacerbate the cognitive and gait dysfunction in this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Meclizine is a medication that is effective in the management of dizziness of vestibular origin. Vestibular injury causing dizziness can follow whiplash injuries. However, the physical examination findings in this patient suggest an alternative diagnosis to explain his complaints. A CT scan of the head is imperative to rule out the presence of a possible hematoma before the administration of any medication.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Physical therapy is the incorrect choice. Although physical rehabilitation is important to improve a patient's mobility and functional ability, this is a premature step at this point. Dizziness, mental cloudiness and a positive Romberg test on physical examination suggest a neurological cause of this patient's complaints. Neuroimaging should be completed first in a patient with this history and these examination findings.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The next best step in management of a patient with head trauma is a CT of the head without contrast.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1147993-overview" target="_search">Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/12/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>155 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/280245-overview" target="_search">"Malignant Melanoma"</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Skin, Nail &amp; Hair Disorders<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Integumentary System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 55-year-old male presents to the office for an annual physical examination.

This is a common scenario for the formation of compartment syndrome, which is characterized by the following physical examination findings: pain, paresthesia, pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis. Clinical findings of acute compartment syndrome generally correlate with increasing compartment pressures. Pain develops as tissue pressures reach 20-30 mmHg. Capillary blood flow becomes compromised when tissue pressure increases to 25-30 and ischemia occurs when tissue pressure approaches systemic diastolic blood pressure.

The infant weighed 7lbs 8oz at birth and was born at 41 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She denies lower extremity weakness and urinary incontinence or retention. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 98.6 F, a blood pressure of 120/81 mmHg, a heart rate of 63, a respiratory rate of 16 and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Physical exam reveals 5/5 strength of the lower extremities bilaterally and intact two point discrimination. Structural examination reveals both the standing and seated flexion tests are negative.

The key to this question is the negative seated flexion test. Typically, the seated flexion test is positive on the opposite side of the oblique axis. The seated flexion test is negative when there is no sacral dysfunction and when there is a sacral dysfunction in which both sides of the sacral base move symmetrically in the same direction.&nbsp;In this case, a&nbsp;springing (anterior) motion of the sacral base is free, indicating that the sacral base has moved anteriorly. A springing motion of both inferolateral angles (ILA) is restricted, indicating that the ILAs have moved posteriorly. Therefore, the sacrum prefers flexion and resists extension.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A bilateral sacral extension (sacral base posterior) would also present with negative seated and standing flexion tests, however, the lumbosacral spring test would demonstrate no spring at the sacral base.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A forward sacral torsion can be one of two possibilities: A left on left sacral torsion would have a positive seated flexion test on the right, a deep right sacral sulcus, and a deep right ILA. A right on right would have a positive seated flexion test on the left, shallow right sacral sulcus, and shallow right ILA.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The seated and standing flexion tests in this case are "falsely" negative. Increased lumbar curve, deep superior sulci bilaterally and restricted ILAs bilaterally are consistent with bilateral sacral flexion.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A backward sacral torsion can be one of two possibilities: A right on left sacral torsion would have a positive seated flexion test on the right, a deep left sacral sulcus, and a deep left ILA. A left on right sacral torsion would have a positive seated flexion test on the left, a shallow left sacral sulcus, and shallow left ILA.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The seated flexion test is negative when there is no sacral dysfunction or when there is a symmetric sacral dysfunction, such as bilateral sacral flexion or extension.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>In addition to diagnosing sacral dysfunctions, there are classic scenarios that are associated with particular sacral dysfunctions. Bilateral sacral flexion is commonly associated with childbirth.

It is a difficult diagnosis to make as symptoms can come and go and patients typically don't seek treatment until symptoms are more severe. A audiogram can be ordered for patients to help distinguish what frequencies patients have a hard time hearing as&nbsp;Ménière’s Disease typically results in loss of ability to hear low frequencies with preservation of hearing in high frequencies. This unique presentation is typically only found in&nbsp;Ménière’s Disease type of hearing loss. The clinical presentation, signs, and symptoms with the audiogram demonstrating loss of low-frequency hearing is highly suggestive of&nbsp;Ménière’s Disease.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Presbyacusis is also known as age related hearing loss. With age related hearing loss a person can usually hear low-pitched sounds better than high-pitched sounds. Clarity of sound is affected – ‘I can tell that someone is talking but cannot understand what they have said’. The audiogram typically slopes from the left to the right, which means they lose hearing ability of high-pitched sounds.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Typically, the audiogram of someone with Ménière’s Disease slopes from right to left, this indicates that the person has trouble hearing low pitched sounds rather then high pitched sounds. This is very typical of Ménière’s Disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Sensorineural hearing loss typically results in loss of hearing across a diverse range of frequencies. The audiogram of a patient with sensorineural hearing loss will show diminished hearing ability across both low and high frequencies.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A patient with conductive hearing loss audiogram looks similar to a sensorineural hearing loss audiogram, in that hearing is depressed across a vast array of frequencies.

Risk factors include a positive family history, low fluid intake, gout, medications such as allopurinol, chemotherapy and loop diuretics, enzyme deficiencies, type I RTA and hyperparathyroidism. It usually presents in older males but may also occur in other age groups. It presents with acute onset of severe, colicky flank pain that may radiate to the testes or vulva and can be associated with nausea and vomiting. Patients are often unable to get comfortable and shift position frequently. UA may show gross or microscopic hematuria and altered urine pH. A KUB identifies radiopaque stones but will miss 10% of stones that are radiolucent. A noncontrast abdominal CT scan is the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney stones. Hydration and analgesia are the initial treatments.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Calcium phosphate stones are the second most common type of renal stones.

A premature infant that develops feeding intolerance, bloating, and development of pneumatosis intestinalis on abdominal xray is pathognomonic for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The treatment at this time would be to make the patient NPO, fluid rehydration, and bowel rest. Some cases of NEC can resolve on their own with conservative treatment but a large number of patients with NEC end up developing bowel perforation that requires a partial bowel resection. Development of free intra abdominal air is a surgical emergency. The overall prognosis in patient is full blown NEC is poor.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Pyloric stenosis is incorrect because the presentation does not fit it. Typical pyloric stenosis is a first born male that develops projectile bilious emesis after being fed.

Acute angle closure is defined as at least 2 of the following symptoms: ocular pain, nausea/vomiting, and a history of intermittent blurring of vision with halos; and at least 3 of the following signs: IOP greater than 21 mm Hg, conjunctival injection, corneal epithelial edema, mid-dilated nonreactive pupil, and shallower chamber in the presence of occlusion.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye.  It affects your vision.  Cataracts are very common in older people. A cataract can occur in either or both eyes. It cannot spread from one eye to the other. Cataracts usually develop slowly.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Age-related macular degeneration — also called macular degeneration, AMD or ARMD — is deterioration of the macula, which is the small central area of the retina of the eye that controls visual acuity. There are 2 types of ARMD - wet and dry. The dry form is more common than the wet form, with about 85 to 90 percent of AMD patients diagnosed with dry AMD. The wet form of the disease usually leads to more serious vision loss. Dry AMD is an early stage of the disease and may result from the aging and thinning of macular tissues, depositing of pigment in the macula or a combination of the two processes.Dry macular degeneration is diagnosed when yellowish spots known as drusen begin to accumulate in and around the macula. It is believed these spots are deposits or debris from deteriorating tissue. With wet macular degeneration, new blood vessels grow beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid. This leakage causes permanent damage to light-sensitive retinal cells, which die off and create blind spots in central vision.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye and sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain. When the retina detaches, it is lifted or pulled from its normal position. If not promptly treated, retinal detachment can cause permanent vision loss.
There are three different types of retinal detachment:
<strong>Rhegmatogenous </strong>—A tear or break in the retina allows fluid to get under the retina and separate it from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the pigmented cell layer that nourishes the retina. These types of retinal detachments are the most common.
<strong>Tractional</strong>—In this type of detachment, scar tissue on the retina’s surface contracts and causes the retina to separate from the RPE. This type of detachment is less common.
<strong>Exudative</strong>—Frequently caused by retinal diseases, including inflammatory disorders and injury/trauma to the eye. In this type, fluid leaks into the area underneath the retina, but there are no tears or breaks in the retina.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Uveitis is a general term describing a group of inflammatory diseases that produces swelling and destroys eye tissues. These diseases can slightly reduce vision or lead to severe vision loss. The term “uveitis” is used because the diseases often affect a part of the eye called the uvea. Nevertheless, uveitis is not limited to the uvea. These diseases also affect the lens, retina, optic nerve, and vitreous, producing reduced vision or blindness.

<br> The most likely diagnosis is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">epidural hematoma</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">intraparenchymal hemorrhage</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">subdural hematoma</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">traumatic tap</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>The patient is presenting with symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The most common causes of SAH are trauma and ruptured berry aneurysms. Classically patients will present with a severe posterior headache associated with nausea and vomiting due to the increased intracranial pressure and neck pain due to meningeal irritation caused by the blood in the subarachnoid space. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is the first-line diagnostic imaging of choice, however, it can be negative in small hemorrhages. In cases where SAH is suspected a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is necessary. A classic sign of SAH is xanthochromia, a yellow discoloration of the CSF, which occurs when red blood cells have been present for at least 2 hours. It is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells and the release of heme pigments. Opening pressure of the CSF can be elevated or normal in SAH.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Epidural hematoma generally occurs in the setting of trauma when an arterial collection of blood forms between the inner table of the skull and the dural lining.  This type of injury is typically seen on CT scan of the head and often accompanies an overlying skull fracture.  The patient in this question denies trauma making epidural hematoma unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is usually visible on CT scan of the head but will not cause xanthochromia of the CSF.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Subdural hematomas are a venous accumulation of blood beneath the dura, usually due to damage to the bridging veins. Like epidural hematomas, they are typically caused by trauma and appear as a crescent-shaped collection of blood along the periphery of the brain.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A traumatic tap occurs when a vessel is inadvertently damaged during the lumbar puncture causing red blood cells to contaminate the CSF as it is collected.  The patient in this question has other symptoms concerning for SAH so the RBCs in the CSF should be considered accurate.  Another method used to differentiate between traumatic tap and SAH is to see that the RBCs decrease from tube 1 to tube 4.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Xanthochromia is a yellow discoloration of CSF caused by degraded red blood cells in the subarachnoid space; it is a classic finding in SAH.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1164341-overview" target="_search">"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/3/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>169 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/cps/" target="_search">?Notification of child abuse</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: General Concepts<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Health Care Delivery Issues<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Pediatrics<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother.

The child is up to date with all his immunizations, and is developmentally appropriate for his age. Physical exam shows the child appears uncomfortable and crying while holding his right leg. An x-ray of the child’s right leg shows a spiral fracture of the right femur.

This child has a spiral fracture of the femur, which is very uncommon without a significant amount of force. Although a spiral fracture in itself is not diagnostic of child abuse, as a clinician if you see a spiral fracture without a history of significant trauma, or the story seems suspicious, you must always suspect child abuse. If you are suspect, then you must notify the proper authorities, in this case child protective services. They will conduct an investigation to determine if child abuse is indeed occurring. Just because you report a case to child protective services it does not mean that child abuse has occurred, it’s just that the pattern of injury is suspicious and should be looked into further. This helps to protect the patient and make sure proper care is being provided and it is your duty to report to the authorities the abuse of any vulnerable population.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Confrontation with a parent is never advised. If you are suspicious child abuse has occurred, you must report it to the proper authorities. Also advisable is to speak to the parents and discuss your findings. This helps to open up a channel of communication between the parents and the clinician.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> There is no need to contact the hospital’s ethics committee. There is a clear suspicion of child abuse occurring, the next thing to do for this patient is to notify child protective services so they can conduct an investigation to see if indeed abuse is occurring.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A social worker’s job is to address any social issues that may be contributing to a child’s health. An example would be if a child lives in a house with lead paint, the social worker’s duty would include how to find alternative housing or what else can be done to facilitate moving the child to a safer environment. In this case, there is no role for a social worker. Child protective services must be notified first, an investigation conducted to see whether abuse has occurred and make recommendations based on the investigation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This is inappropriate because there is clear suspicion abuse is occurring. Without notifying child protective services, the physician can be liable for any abuse that is occurring because they did not notify the proper authorities and breached his duty. If you are suspecting abuse, you must notify the proper authorities.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>If you suspect child abuse if occuring, you must notify child protective services.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/cps/" target="_search">?Notification of child abuse</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 11/6/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>170 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/242975-overview" target="_search">"Metabolic Acidosis" on Medscape. </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Trauma<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Scientific Understanding of Health &amp; Disease Mechanisms<br>Body System: Asymptomatic &amp; General Symptoms<br>Discipline: Emergency Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; ">A 54-year-old male presents to the emergency department by ambulance after overdosing on methanol.

Antidote therapy works by delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol can be eliminated from the system either naturally or via dialysis. Ethanol is believed to compete with methanol for ADH, therefore preventing the conversion of methanol to its toxic byproducts. ADH has been shown to have a 10- to 20-fold increased affinity for ethanol over methanol. By slowing methanol metabolism, ethanol is used to prevent accumulation of formic acid. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH but has limited use because of high cost and lack of availability.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Glucagon is used as an antidote for beta-blocker toxicity.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Methylene blue is the antidote for methemoglobinemia that should be watched for in a patient thought to have overdosed on nitrates, nitroprusside, or antimalarials.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> N-acetylcysteine regenerates glutathione and is used to prevent the toxic metabolism of acetaminophen.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Opioids such as heroin cause euphoric behavior, miosis, constipation, and ultimately can lead to respiratory depression and even death.

The pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all adults older than 65 years and for younger patients with certain conditions such as COPD, asthma, diabetes and active smokers. Annual influenza vaccinations is recommended for all persons 6 months and older during the influenza season. The main vaccination used in the United States is the trivalent inactivated virus. There is an intranasal form that is live and attenuated. This is administered only to patients age 5-49 years who are not pregnant, immunosuppressed, or living with an immunosuppressed person. A single reactivation with the pneumococcal vaccine is recommended in adults older than 65 years if they were vaccinated more than 5 years previously at a time when they were younger than 65 and in immunosuppressed patients 5 years or more after the first dose.

These patients typically&nbsp;present with significant ophthalmologic disease without significant systemic&nbsp;weakness, bulbar symptoms or respiratory distress (though it can progress to&nbsp;these).&nbsp; Their symptoms typically fluctuate&nbsp;during the day and are fatigable as&nbsp;seen with systemic MG. The most common symptoms are ptosis and diplopia. Acetylcholine&nbsp;receptor binding antibody (AChR-ab) is typically found in about 85-95% of&nbsp;patients with systemic MG, but they are only seen in about 45-50% of those with&nbsp;OMG. Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) in experienced hands can have a&nbsp;sensitivity up to 100%. Treatment for OMG is similar to systemic MG; the&nbsp;anticholinesterase agent pyridostigmine is the mainstay of chronic treatment.&nbsp;Prednisone and other glucocorticoids are frequently used in chronic therapy and&nbsp;management of exacerbations. Steroid sparing agents such azathioprine,&nbsp;mycophenolate and cyclosporine have also been used.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A CT scan of the chest is commonly done in any type of MG to evaluate for a thymic hyperplasia or thymoma. It is believed that thymic abnormalities produce the ACh-R antibodies. Thymectomy is then sometimes performed in appropriate patients.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Edrophonium or Tensilon test could be performed in this patient. It is typically done only in patients with an objective finding (such as ptosis or ophthalmoparesis) as the effect of the drug can be easily observed. The sensitivity of the edrophonium test is about 95% in generalized myasthenia and reportedly similar in ocular myasthenia with ptosis. However, diplopia fails to respond in about a third of patients  and long-standing myasthenia may not respond at all. Also, false-positive results have been described in other neuromuscular, neuropathic, and central conditions, including brain stem gliomas and other tumours<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Muscle specific tyrosine kinase antibody (MuSK antibody) is the second most common antibody seen in myasthenia gravis. It is found in 38-50% of patients who are AChR antibody negative. It is rarely seen in ocular MG.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Repetitive nerve stimulation is widely used as a confirmatory test in MG, but it is less sensitive than SFEMG. It is typically done by stimulating a nerve at low rate (3 hertz) 6-10 times. The compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) are then recorded. In normal muscle, there will be no change. MG patients will have a progressive decline (a decrement).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Single fiber electromyography&nbsp;is the most specific and sensitive test for any type of MG.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Myasthenia gravis is commonly tested subject. The diagnostic course is usually: 1) AChR-ab 2) MuSK ab 3) RNS 4) SFEMG.

During a hysterectomy the most common location for ureteral injury is in the cardinal ligament, which attaches the cervix to the pelvic wall. Here the ureter is a few centimeters lateral to the cervix and just below the uterine artery (water under the bridge). Due to the proximity of the structures, the ureter can be damaged during ligation of the uterine artery. Intraoperative or postoperative urology consultation is usually required when an injury to the urinary system is identified.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The bladder dome is not commonly injured during hysterectomy and is more commonly injured in bowel surgery.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The bladder trigone is where the ureters enter the bladder.  Injury to it is not as likely as the cardinal ligament.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The location where the ureter crosses the psoas muscle is far enough away from the uterus that it is an uncommon site of injury.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Injury at the pelvic brim can occur during ligation of the ovarian vessels but this is not as common as the injury to the ureter within the cardinal ligament.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The most common location for ureteral injury during a hysterectomy is the cardinal ligament.

This patient has 3 listed coronary artery disease risk factors and is at high risk for acute coronary syndrome including NSTEMI.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Pericarditis is rarely described as an acute onset of substernal chest pain. More likely, it is a gradual progression of pain. Typical ECG findings are diffuse ST segment elevation, PR segment depression. When suspecting pericarditis, remember to look at for an elevated PR segment in aVR.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Stable angina involves episodic pain lasting 5-15 minutes that is provoked by exertion, and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. It is typically associated with transient ST segment depression and is due to relative cardiac ischemia (oxygen demand outweighs supply, causing ischemia and pain).<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The patient is not experiencing an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to lack of ST segment elevation on ECG. The fact that the troponin is positive is indicative of current or recent myocardial cell damage, which can occur for a variety of reasons. STEMI is a clinical and ECG diagnosis, therefore there needs to be ECG criteria met in the right clinical situation to diagnose STEMI.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Unstable angina is defined as chest pain at rest without ECG findings and negative serum cardiac biomarkers. Unstable angina differs from stable angina only by patient description of severity, timing, and occurrence at rest (stable angina occurring with exertion). This patient has a positive troponin, thus making it by definition a NSTEMI.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is distinguished from unstable angina and STEMI by elevated levels of cardiac enzymes in the setting of chest pain and the absence of ST segment elevation on ECG.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1910735-workup" target="_search">"Acute Coronary Syndrome Workup" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/6/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>178 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1910735-treatment#aw2aab6b6b1aa" target="_search">"Acute Coronary Syndrome Treatment &amp; Management" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Sensory Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Cardiovascular System<br>Discipline: Emergency Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; ">A 58-year-old male is hospitalized for lower extremity cellulitis.<span style="Font-Size:16px;  Font-Family:Verdana; ">&nbsp;Past medical history reveals hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.&nbsp;</span>On hospital day number two, the patient develops crushing substernal chest pain.

Aspirin renders platelets inactive by irreversibly inhibiting thromboxane A2 production thus decreasing the rate of thrombus formation within the coronary arteries. Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of ACS treatment and prevention. If a patient does not tolerate aspirin, clopidogrel should be used as an alternative.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are indicated in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and for prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Their use in ACS has not been shown to directly decrease morbidity or mortality. ACE-inhibitors are used post-myocardial infarction management to prevent remodeling of the myocardium and to decrease afterload.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; E:</strong> Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are indicated as prophylaxis for ischemic complications caused by unstable angina and NSTEMI. The data showing improvements in outcomes compare aspirin alone versus aspirin plus UFH or LMWH and likely show a benefit. However, the data regarding true morbidity and mortality of these agents is controversial and overall do not offer the reduction that aspirin does. New data suggests that LMWH is slightly better than UFH and is easier to use due to dosing and monitoring issues associated with UFH.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Nitroglycerin causes relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle (including coronary arteries) via stimulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate production. Nitrates are used to increase blood and oxygen delivery to ischemic cardiac tissue and relieve symptoms of ischemia. Nitrates have not been shown to improve mortality however.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Aspirin is the first line medication in ACS including unstable angina and NSTEMI. It has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with ACS.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Remember, aspirin is given to all patients with known or suspected ACS.

The pain first occurred after she slipped on a wet floor, fell backwards, and landed on her left hand. She went to the urgent care clinic the same day as accident, had x-rays taken, and was sent home with a wrist brace after the x-rays were found to be negative for fracture. The forearm pain has improved significantly since the accident, but has not completely resolved. She denies paresthesia, radiating pain, or muscle weakness. Physical exam is notable for stiffness in left elbow extension, left wrist range of motion in all directions, tenderness to palpation at the radial head, and radial head motion restriction. Using direct muscle energy treatment, the physician takes the patient’s left forearm into pronation until the restrictive barrier edge is palpated and instructs the patient to supinate against the physician’s equal counterforce. A few seconds later, the patient relaxes and the physician pronates the patient’s arm until a new restrictive barrier is appreciated. This procedure is repeated 3-5 times.

Anterior radial head somatic dysfunctions typically result from a backward fall, where the patient extends her arm, and lands on the palm of the hand to break the fall. The forearm is in the supinated anatomic position. The distal radius moves posterior as a result and the radial head moves anterior. Direct muscle energy treatment to treat a radial head somatic dysfunction involves pronation or supination of the forearm. As the physician pronates the patient’s forearm into the restrictive barrier, the patient’s radial head moves posterior.

Intermittent asthma, which requires only a short acting beta agonist such as albuterol, is defined as symptoms no more than twice a week and night-time symptoms no more than two times a month. When symptoms progress to more than twice a week or nighttime symptoms more than twice per month asthma can be described as persistent.

</span></span><br><strong><span class="MultipartTag" style="display: block;">Question 1 of 2 in this set</span></strong><br><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">The most likely etiology of his current symptoms is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">alcohol withdrawal</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">akathisia</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">delirium</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">hepatic encephalopathy</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">pulmonary embolism</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is most likely in this patient because he has a history of alcoholism, and has been in the hospital for at least 8-12 hours, away from alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal presents initially with agitation and tremors, and depending on the person and amount of daily alcohol ingestion, can even occur while there is ethanol still detectable in the bloodstream. The tremors of alcohol withdrawal are typically high frequency, low volume, and present at rest. Additionally, acute alcohol withdrawal is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity indicated by tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and anxiety. Alcohol withdrawal presents soon after the cessation of alcohol ingestion in chronic alcoholics and begins first with tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension. It then progresses to seizures, delirium, and hallucinations.<br> <br> On exam this patient exhibits a few osteopathic findings that are characteristic of liver disease including viscerosomatic reflex from T6-10, anterior chapman point in the right 6th intercostal space, and diaphragm restriction as a result of inflammation and hepatomegaly.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Akathisia is a feeling of motor restlessness and inner-anxiety that occurs most commonly following the administration of medications that blocks dopamine (most commonly antipsychotics such as haloperidol, metoclopramide, and thioridazine) in the central nervous system. It is the mildest of the extrapyramidal symptoms (others being dystonia, dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome). This question does not mention the patient receiving any medications, therefore it makes medication side effect such as akathisia less likely. In addition, the question asks about the etiology of the symptoms, which is alcohol withdrawal, as some sources cite the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as being a type of akathisia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Delirium is a clinical syndrome of waxing and waning levels of orientation commonly associated with visual hallucinations. The causes of delirium are myriad, but most commonly include infection, medication reaction, “sundowning”, and simply being hospitalized. It is much more common in elderly patients. Usually delirium does not involve vital sign abnormalities or tremor, as it is simply a confusional state associated with vivid visual hallucinations. Delirium tremens is a separate entity, and is the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. It occurs usually beyond 2-3 days after the cessation of alcohol use in a person dependent on alcohol.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Hepatic encephalopathy occurs in patients with liver dysfunction (cirrhosis) due to buildup of toxic metabolites (most commonly thought to be ammonia) in the brain. Classic symptoms include disorientation, confusion, and day-night reversal. The classic physical exam finding is called asterixis and is described as a “flapping tremor” when hands are held in extension with arms outstretched. While this patient has cirrhosis, he does not have confusion or a decreased level of arousal to suggest encephalopathy. In addition, hepatic encephalopathy does not usually cause autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension,  and diaphoresis).<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> In the right clinical context, a pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause tachycardia, diaphoresis, but should not cause a tremor. This patient is also very early in his hospital course and is not yet at risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis due to immobility. In addition, this question stem does not mention hypoxemia, chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg swelling to suggest that a PE is the cause of the symptoms.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Alcohol withdrawal presents soon after the cessation of alcohol ingestion in chronic alcoholics and begins first with tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Know the stages of alcohol withdrawal - 1) 6-12 hours - tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, 2) 12-48 hours - seizures, 3) 2-7 days - delirium tremens.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819502-overview." target="_search">"Withdrawal Syndromes " on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/6/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>184 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819502-overview " target="_search">"Withdrawal Syndromes " on Medscape. </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Substance Abuse<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Nervous System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana;  Font-Size:16px; "><span id="internal-source-marker_0.21873312816283141" style="font-variant: normal; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000;">A 45-year-old male presents to the emergency department after being hit by a car at low speed.&nbsp; P<span style="Font-Family:Verdana; ">ast medical history reveals hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and alcoholism.&nbsp;</span>Vital signs reveal a temperature of 37.2º C (99º F), a blood pressure of 132/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 72/minute, a respiratory rate of 16/minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

</span></span><br><strong><span class="MultipartTag" style="display: block;">Question 2 of 2 in this set</span></strong><br><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">The best medication to prevent a seizure is</div><br><div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">chlordiazepoxide</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">lactulose</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">levetiracetam</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">phenytoin</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">propofol</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>The mainstay of treatment for alcohol withdrawal is with benzodiazepines. Examples of this class of medication include chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam, and clorazepate. Chlordiazepoxide&nbsp;and lorazepam are the two most commonly used medications. Benzodiazepines and ethanol are both active on the GABA receptor, therefore withdrawal from one can be treated by the other. Often patients can require extremely large doses of intravenous benzodiazepines or barbiturates to prevent seizures or autonomic instability.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Lactulose is one of several medications given to patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by bacterial flora into acidic moieties, thereby acidifying the colonic contents (increasing the H+ concentration in the gut). This promotes the formation of the nonabsorbable NH4+ from NH3, trapping ammonium in the colon. This process effectively reduces the plasma NH3 concentrations that eventually end up in the CNS and affecting cognition.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Levetiracetam is an anti-seizure medication but is used in the treatment of epilepsy. If this patient had a seizure, it would be due to alcohol withdrawal. The best way to prevent this to treat the withdrawal with benzodiazepines<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Phenytoin is another anti-seizure medication. Again, the best way to prevent seizures in a patient undergoing alcohol withdrawal is to prevent withdrawal with benzodiazepines<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Propofol is an anesthetic used in surgeries and for sedation. It is a powerful anti-seizure medication and is in refractory status epilepticus.

It works both in the periphery and in the central nervous system with its primary site of action in the gastrointestinal tract. Since ondansetron does not have any effect on dopamine receptors, extrapyramidal side effects are not seen with its use. The most common side effect of ondansetron is headache. It is most commonly used as an anti-emetic in patients with gastroenteritis, chemotherapy or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting, or post-operative nausea and vomiting. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, prolonged Q-T intervals, and phenylketonuria.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> is expressed widely throughout the CNS. High concentrations of this receptor in the cortex may modulate cognitive processes, working memory, and attention. In the periphery, it is highly expressed in platelets and many cell types of the cardiovascular system, in fibroblasts, and in neurons of the peripheral nervous system. It is not implicated in GI functionality.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are present in several critical sites involved in emesis, including vagal afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Dopaminergic stimulation (via D2 receptors) in the GI tract is implicated in inducing nausea, vomiting, gastric irritation and reflux.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Dopamine antagonists, such as metoclopramide, are also used as an anti-emetic as it blocks the effect of dopamine in the GI tract, especially at high doses.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and stimulates vagal afferents (via 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (Ondansetron) suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. A serotonin receptor agonist would have the opposite effect.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The mechanism of action of ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor blocker that is used as an anti-emetic in children and adults.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>"Serotonin modulators: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects".

Two types of CRPS are recognized: type I in which there is no definable nerve lesion and type II in which a definite peripheral nerve injury is present. The patient in the scenario above has no defined nerve lesion and a normal electromyography (EMG) study of the extremity, which would make her most likely diagnosis complex regional pain syndrome type I. Chronic regional pain syndrome often begins after a minor or major injury, although it can also occur without a precipitating event. The diagnosis is suggested by severe pain, often burning or throbbing, as well as altered skin temperature. Emotional stress may also be a contributing factor.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Complex regional pain syndrome type II has a defined peripheral nerve injury present.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Peripheral neuropathy would be evident on EMG.

The menisci act to primarily share the load across the knee joint by increasing contact area and decreasing contact stress. They also provide stability, absorb shock, increase articular congruity, aid in lubrication, prevent synovial impingement and limit extremes of flexion and extension. They are vascularized by the superior, inferior and middle genicular arteries. The blood supply decreases from a peripheral to central direction, creating three zones of vascularity; red-red, red-white and white-white, with the red-red zone the only area receiving direct vascularization. The medial meniscus is torn three times more often than the lateral meniscus, due to loading biomechanics across the knee. However, the lateral meniscus is torn more often with concomitant anterior cruciate ligament tears. The most common mechanism of injury in young athletes is a twisting motion or change of direction. In older patients, squatting or falling is the more common mechanism of injury. Patients will experience immediate pain followed by a delayed effusion. They may also experience locking, catching, clicking or giving way; due to the torn meniscus interfering with the articulating surfaces.<br> <br> You may note the following osteopathic findings in patients with a torn meniscus: viscerosomatic reflex from T11-L2 (lower extremity), local irritation to the IT band, hamstring spasms and tenderness.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears occur from non-contact, cutting and twisting mechanisms that occur when landing from a jump or changing direction.  Patients experience immediate pain and an early effusion as well as instability.  A positive Lachman’s test is highly suggestive of an ACL tear.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Lateral meniscal tears occur at one-third the rate as medial meniscal tears. Patients with lateral meniscal tears will complain of the same symptoms and present with the same mechanisms of injury. Without an MRI to help determine which meniscus is torn, the odds favor a medial meniscal tear in this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries occur when a valgus or varus force is applied across the knee, respectively.  The patient will complain of pain and swelling, but usually will not have an effusion, since these structures are extra-articular.  Varus-valgus stress testing will aid in the diagnoses by demonstrating gapping of the affected knee as compared to the uninjured knee.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries are less common because they require a powerful force. It usually occurs secondary to a powerful blow to a flexed knee such as in a motor vehicle accident or athletic injury. A twisting or hyperextension injury may also cause this.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Meniscal tears are most commonly caused by a twisting or change of direction mechanism in young athletes, while squatting or falling cause tears in older patients. Patients present with knee pain, an effusion and may experience locking, clicking, catching or giving way. A positive McMurray’s and Apley’s test are suggestive of a meniscal tear. On average, medial meniscal tears are three times more common than lateral meniscal tears.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/content/meniscal-injury-of-the-knee" target="_search">"Meniscal injury of the knee" on UpToDate.  </a><br>Miller MD, Thompson SR, Hart JA, et al.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review of Orthopaedics.</span> Philadelphia, PA: Elseiver-Saunders; 2012: 294.<br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/8/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>188 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniscal-injury-of-the-knee" target="_search">Meniscal injury of the knee UpToDate. </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;"><span style="Font-Family:Verdana; ">A 19-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of five days of right knee pain following a club basketball game.

It may also demonstrate an effusion, bone contusion, other ligamentous damage and whether the torn meniscus is displaced. Meniscal tears may be treated non-operatively if; they are stable, longitudinal tears &lt; 10mm in length and &lt; 5mm of displacement, degenerative tears with significant osteoarthritis, short radial tears &lt; 3mm or stable partial tears. These tears are treated with ice, rest, NSAIDs and physical therapy. Surgery is indicated if the tear is a vertical longitudinal tear, a radial tear &gt;3mm, a flap, a horizontal cleavage or a complex tear. Only vertical longitudinal tears are repaired, while all other tears receive a partial meniscectomy.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Bone scans are useful in diagnosing stress fractures and osteomyelitis, but are not particularly helpful for meniscal tears as it is primarily a soft-tissue structure.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> CT scans have been largely replaced by MRI for the evaluation of soft tissue structures, such as the meniscus.  They may be used if an MRI is contraindicated for the patient.  CT lacks the definition of soft-tissues that MRI provides.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Ultrasound is beneficial for evaluating soft tissue lesions about the knee, such as patellar tendonitis, hematomas and extensor tendon ruptures.  They offer little diagnostic value for the evaluation of meniscal injuries, however.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> X-rays are an initial diagnostic modality that will be performed to rule out bony injury, however they will not provide the soft tissue imagery necessary to diagnose a torn meniscus.  Occasionally, an x-ray may show increased lateral joint space, which may indicate a discoid lateral meniscus.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>MRI is the diagnostic study of choice to evaluate meniscal injuries, as it provides excellent definition of the structure and can demonstrate if the tear is partial or complete based on the signal intensity and location.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/meniscal-injury-of-the-knee" target="_search">Meniscal injury of the knee UpToDate. </a><br>Miller MD, Thompson SR, Hart JA, et al. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review of Orthopaedics</span>.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer and comprises up to 40% of cases. Adenocarcinoma typically occurs peripherally within the lung and arises from bronchial mucosal glands which secrete mucin. Unlike small cell and squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinoma is commonly found in non-smokers, particularly females.<br> <br> As with any pathology in the lungs, the osteopathic findings can be helpful in determining the location of the underlying disease process.&nbsp; The viscerosomatic reflex from T2-5 tells us that the lungs are involved and then we can use Chapman points if present to help determine which lung field is involved.&nbsp; In this example we see the right 4th intercostal space which indicates right lower lung field.&nbsp; Anteriorly, chapman points can present in the 3rd ICS for the upper lungs, and 4th ICS for lower lungs.&nbsp; Posteriorly, chapman points are found around the transverse process of T3 for upper and T4 for lower.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is where inflammation causes fibrosis of the lungs. The cause is unknown and patients usually present with progressive dyspnea and dry crackles. Patients are often over 50 years of age, unlike this case. A chest radiograph would reveal a ground glass appearance diffusely involving both lungs whereas the radiograph in this case reveals a mass in the periphery of one lung field.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Large cell carcinomas are the least common of the non-small cell lung cancers and comprise anywhere form 5-15% of all lung cancers. They often arise in a peripheral lung field and grow rapidly resulting in frequent cavitation. Patients may present with cough and dyspnea, along with pleuritic chest pain resulting from irritation of the parietal pleura and chest wall.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Squamous cell carcinomas are most common in smokers and are almost always centrally located. They may produce symptoms of cough, dyspnea, atelectasis, wheezing, and hemoptysis. Chest x-rays reveal a coin-like lesion that may be cavitary. This type of lung cancer can affect calcium homeostasis by producing a parathyroid like protein. This is best treated with surgery if localized.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Small cell carcinomas are common in smokers and are often centrally located. This type of lung cancer grows rapidly which results in early metastasis. Many paraneoplastic syndromes are associated with small cell carcinomas as a result of the production and secretion of ADH (SIADH), ACTH (Cushing's syndrome), or antibodies to calcium channels (Lambert-Eaton syndrome). Primary therapy involves chemotherapy with consideration for adjuvant radiation instead of surgical resection.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Adenocarcinoma is the most common non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, arises peripherally from mucin-producing glandular tissue, and is classically seen in female non-smokers.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Respiratory Neoplasms section in Pulmonary Disorders, Step up to USMLE Step 2, pages 42-45.<br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 12/9/2016</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>191 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/279960-overview" target="_search">"Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer" on Medscape. </a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Respiratory Difficulties<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Respiratory System<br>Discipline: Internal Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 40-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a cough and dyspnea that has been worsening for 4 weeks' duration.

The spontaneous onset of pain, redness, and swelling in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the great toe is characteristic of podagra, the most common presentation of gout. &nbsp;Gout should be considered in any patient who presents with monoarticular arthritis of any joint (with the exception of the glenohumeral joint as this is typically indicative of pseudogout). &nbsp;Risk factors for gout include excessive alcohol and protein intake in addition to dehydration. &nbsp;Gout is more common in middle-aged to elderly male patients, but it can occur in younger males as well. &nbsp;Radiographic findings will rule out fracture and may demonstrate soft tissue swelling. &nbsp;The most accurate test for diagnosing tophaceous gout is joint aspiration revealing a white blood cell (predominantly neutrophils) count between 2,000 and 50,000 with negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals. &nbsp;Any time a patient presents with acute pain, erythema, and warmth of a joint it should be tapped to exclude septic arthritis.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This is seen in osteoarthritis.

The inflammatory reaction is of similar intensity in both tophaceous gout and in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD, "pseudogout") resulting in similarly elevated white blood cell counts.  These patients are typically of advanced age.  In addition, the knee is affected in over 50% of all acute attacks while the first metatarsophalangeal joint is the most frequently affected in urate gout.

Elevated serum uric acid levels are the principal risk factor for developing gout. lIn study that compared 993 patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and 4,241 normouricemic patients, the odds ratio (OR) for developing gout was 32 times higher in the hyperuricemic group than in the normouricemic group. The risk was most striking in men with severe hyperuricemia, in whom the OR for developing gout was 624.8. Although gout is associated with hyperuricemia, gout attacks are triggered not by a particular level of uric acid but typically by acute changes in the level of uric acid. All individuals with gout have hyperuricemia; however, hyperuricemia is also found in patients taking diuretics and even in those taking niacin or low doses of aspirin. Because uric acid is a breakdown product of purine, high-purine foods should be either avoided or consumed only in moderation. Foods very high in purines include organ meats such as sweetbreads (eg, pancreas and thymus), smelt, sardines, and mussels. Foods moderately high in purines include anchovies, trout, haddock, scallops, mutton, veal, liver, bacon, salmon, kidneys, and turkey. Overall, purine restriction generally reduces serum uric acid levels by no more than 1 mg/mL, with modest impact, and diets with very low purine content are not palatable. Diet modifications alone are rarely able to lower uric acid levels sufficiently to prevent accumulation of urate, but they may help lessen the triggers of acute gout attacks. Patients with gout should avoid excess ingestion of alcoholic drinks, particularly beer, because alcohol use elevates uric acid levels and thus can precipitate attacks of gout. Indeed, heavy drinkers are much more likely to have recurrent gout attacks, even with allopurinol therapy. Moderate wine intake is not associated with increased development of incident gout, but excesses of any form of alcohol in gout patients are associated with acute gout flares. Patients should avoid sodas and other beverages or foods sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. They should also limit their use of naturally sweet fruit juices, table sugar, and sweetened beverages and desserts, as well as table salt. Maintaining a high level of hydration with water (at least 8 glasses of liquids per day) may be helpful in avoiding attacks of gout. In view of the association of gout with atherosclerosis, the diagnosis of gout may afford a particularly good opportunity for the clinician to advise a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet if such a diet is otherwise appropriate for the patient. Although a diet of this type may help uric acid levels, such advice should be given primarily to help prevent atherosclerosis. Evidence has shown that low-fat dairy products have been proven to lower the incidence of gout flares. Low-fat dairy products reduce uricosuric products and are anti-inflammatory in nature.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Some medications such as thiazide diuretics are also known to increase uric acid levels and precipitate gout. Therefore, this would be an incorrect answer choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Substances rich in purines, such as alcohol, are known to precipitate acute gouty attacks. The patient should be informed that his excessive use of alcohol is likely the cause of his symptoms. Other foods that are likely to increase gout attacks include high protein foods such as fish, mussels, and meats, especially organ meats. Although wine has shown to not be as abrasive as beer, alcohol consumption in general is linked to gouty flares. Therefore, red wine is not recommended.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Seafood, in particular, anchovies, herring, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel and tuna have been shown to increase the chances of making gout worse.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Intake of high-fructose beverages such as soft drinks and fruit juices are associated with gout flares. The metabolism of fructose can cause increased uric acid production.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Low-fat dairy products have been shown to reduce gout flares.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout" target="_search">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout" on UpToDate.</a><br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/329958-treatment#d10" target="_search">Gout - E Medicine</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 4/21/2017</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>196 of 200</strong></div><br>insert Link<br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Musculoskeletal Difficulties And Muscular Pain<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Management<br>Body System: Musculoskeletal System<br>Discipline: Family Medicine<br></div></div><span class="MultipartHead" style="display: block;">A 21-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of severe pain in his right first toe.&nbsp; History reveals that there has not been any trauma to the extremity.

NSAIDs such as indomethacin are the mainstay therapy for acute gout attacks. High doses are given for 2-5 days until the symptoms have subsided. Colchicine was the mainstay of treatment of acute gout flares in the past. However, it is rarely used because of its high side effect profile. Once the acute attack is resolved prophylactic agents such as allopurinol can be given.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Colchicine decreases leukocyte motility (and thus inflammatory response) can also be used for the acute treatment of gout but it is associated with more side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, and thrombocytopenia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cosyntropin is an adrenocorticotropic hormone that works by stimulating endogenous steroid production and is used for the treatment of acute crystal-induced arthritis in postoperative patients and those who cannot take oral medications.

This is most often characterized by Charcot's triad of clinical features including fever, RUQ pain and jaundice. The addition of hypotension and altered mental status would be consistent with Reynold's pentad which may be seen in some patients with worsening acute cholangitis. The most common cause of acute cholangitis is a stone in the common bile duct, also known as choledocholithiasis. Laboratory analysis will reveal signs of inflammation and infection (elevated white blood cells) as well as biliary obstruction (elevated ALT, AST, and direct bilirubin).<br> <br> Viscerosomatic reflexes may result in tissue changes in the thoracic paravertebral musculature corresponding to the sympathetic innervation of the involved tissue.&nbsp; The gallbladder will cause changes from T8-10, the liver T7-9, so since cholangitis affects the gallbladder, bile duct, and liver, you would expect to see viscerosomatic reflexes somewhere between T7-10.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder that most commonly results from a gallstone in the cystic duct (cholelithiasis). Because the common bile duct is not obstructed (choledocholithiasis), the patient is usually not jaundiced and the laboratory analysis very rarely reveals signs of obstruction as seen in this case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Acute pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that most commonly presents as severe, epigastric pain that radiates to the mid back. Most patients also have nausea, vomiting, and fever with no signs of jaundice as in this case. The most common causes include alcohol consumption and gallstones. Laboratory analysis would reveal elevated amylase and lipase with no signs of biliary obstruction as in this case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Cholelithiasis describes a gallstone in the cystic duct, not the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis). This may eventually result in cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder. A patient with cholelithiasis is usually not jaundiced and the laboratory analysis very rarely reveals signs of obstruction as seen in this case.

History reveals the symptoms began three hours ago. She recently returned home from a twelve-hour flight. Past medical history is noncontributory and the only medications she admits to taking daily are oral contraceptive pills. She admits to a recent tobacco use that began six months ago.

Risk factors include the patient's age above 35 years, oral contraceptive use, tobacco use, and recent travel. The best imaging studies to diagnose pulmonary embolism are pulmonary angiography or a contrast-enhanced CT angiography. CT angiography is the initial imaging modality of choice for stable patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, but is not a choice in the above scenario.&nbsp;Pulmonary angiography is the test of choice with CT angiography is not available.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Chest radiographs are abnormal in most cases of pulmonary embolism, but the findings are nonspecific. Common radiographic abnormalities include atelectasis, pleural effusion, parenchymal opacities, and elevation of a hemidiaphragm. The classic radiographic findings of pulmonary infarction include a wedge-shaped, pleura-based triangular opacity with an apex pointing toward the hilus (Hampton hump) or decreased vascularity (Westermark sign). These findings are suggestive of pulmonary embolism but are infrequently observed.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Echocardiogram is rarely done to diagnose PE. Findings include tricuspid regurgitation, increased right ventricular size and decreased right ventricular function. Positive findings on echocardiogram are found in about 30-40% of patients with PE.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Lower extremity Doppler to look for a DVT is appropriate if CT angiography or pulmonary angiography are not available and the V/Q scan is inconclusive for a patient with high clinical probability. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can be proven by demonstrating the presence of a DVT at any site. This may sometimes be accomplished noninvasively by using duplex ultrasonography. A negative ultrasonographic scan does not rule out DVT, because many DVTs occur in areas that are inaccessible to ultrasonographic examination.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A non-contrast CT plays no role. Contrast is needed to detect the embolism within the blood vessel.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A pulmonary angiogram or contrast enhanced chest CT is the next best step in management for stable patients with a high clinical suspicion PE.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism" target="_search">"Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism" on UpToDate.</a><br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/300901-workup#aw2aab6b5c13" target="_search">"Pulmonary Embolism Workup" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 8/27/2017</em></span><hr></div></div><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"><div class="container"><div class="container-fluid"><div><strong>200 of 200</strong></div><br><div><strong>Link: <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/405454-overview" target="_search">"Ultrasonography in biophysical profile" on Medscape.</a></strong></div><br><br><div class="well well-lg"><div class="AnalysisBody3">Patient Presentation: Pregnancy/Childbirth/Postpartum/Neonatal Assessment<br>Physician Tasks/ Skills: Diagnostic Technologies<br>Body System: Asymptomatic &amp; General Symptoms<br>Discipline: Obstetrics/Gynecology<br></div></div><div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 28-year-old <span class="Highlight">female</span>, gravida two, para one, presents to the office with the complaint of decreased fetal movement.
