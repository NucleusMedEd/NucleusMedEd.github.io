            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 2-year-old female is brought to the pediatrician's office by her mother with the complaint of knee pain, stiffness, and a limp. History reveals that symptom onset was approximately two months ago. Her mother also notes that she has been having daily fevers for the past two weeks. Physical examination reveals an ill appearing child who walks with a limp and&nbsp;guards her right leg&nbsp;with attempts to move her right knee through its range of motion. The knee is warm on palpation with an apparent effusion, however it is not erythematous. There is a salmon-colored macular rash on her trunk&nbsp;that her mother states will come and go with the fever. &nbsp;The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>

Swelling and erythema of the hands and feet occur early followed by desquamation in the second week of the illness.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Rheumatic fever is caused by an autoimmune process following infection with group A streptococci that typically presents with carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules.  It is a clinical diagnosis based on the Jones criteria.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Septic arthritis typically presents with single joint involvement, high fevers, severe pain, and/or erythematous joints.  Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and on findings of arthrocentesis which will reveal bacteria, elevated white blood cells, and positive cultures.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease resulting in diffuse inflammation that typically presents with polyarthritis, malar rashes, renal involvement, serositis, CNS involvement, and/or photosensitivity.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis presents as arthritis with daily, high spiking fevers, and an evanescent salmon-colored macular rash on the trunk.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1007276-overview" target="_search"><br>

If pain is elicited over the distal radius the test is positive and suggests DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis. This condition is an inflammation of the tendons of the first finger. These include the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. DeQuervain's tenosynovitis is especially common in mothers of children 6-12 months old because of repeated use of the pollicis muscles when lifting the child. Treatment initially consists of splinting, activity modification, oral steroids or corticosteroid injections. Refractory cases many be treated with surgical release of the first compartment.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Allen’s test is occlusion of the radial and ulnar arteries with pumping of the fist, then releasing one artery. A positive test is a delay or absence of blood returning to the palm suggestive of compromise in flow of the artery released. This test is to ensure patency of the radial and ulnar arteries before performing an arterial puncture to obtain an arterial blood gas.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Phalen’s test is maximal flexion of both wrists for several minutes causing the reproduction of symptoms (numbness or tingling) suggesting carpal tunnel syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Tinel’s test is performed by tapping the volar wrist; the test is positive when pain and numbness are elicited. This test also suggests the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Watson’s test is performed by pushing the scaphoid anteroposterior with the wrist in radial or ulnar deviation. If the scaphoid subluxes or reduces, this suggests scapholunate ligament injury.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A positive Finkelstein's test elicits pain in the distal radius when the patient ulnar deviates the hand with the thumb in a closed fist.

The fibular head glides anteriorly with pronation (dorsiflexion, eversion, and abduction) of the ankle, and posteriorly with supination (plantarflexion, inversion, and adduction) of the ankle. When the proximal portion of the fibula (fibular head) is "stuck" either in anterior or posterior the distal fibula will be "stuck" in the opposite motion (e.g. an anterior fibular head will have a posterior distal fibula). When the distal fibula is posterior the talus will prefer external rotation. This external rotation causes the foot to prefer eversion and dorsiflexion.

In the United States, human infection with Babesia is primarily due to the rodent strain B. microti, found mostly in northeastern and Midwestern states. The clinical signs and symptoms of babesiosis are related to the parasitism of red blood cells, which enter the host’s bloodstream during the tick bite, infect red blood cells, and then trophozoites are produced. Patient’s with babesiosis have symptoms similar to those of malaria and is related to the degree or parasitism. The disease manifestation is broad, ranging from a silent infection to malaria-like diseases that result in severe hemolysis. The most common symptoms are fatigue and weakness (91%), fever (91%), shaking chills (77%) and diaphoresis (69%). Increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a properly stained peripheral blood smear showing parasite infection of the red blood cells yield the most useful results. If the patient is healthy, treatment is generally not required. However, treatment is recommended for all diagnosed cases to prevent sequelae. Elderly, immunocompromised, or asplenic patients should be put on a treatment regimen of intravenous clindamycin and oral quinine or intravenous atovaquone and azithromycin.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A patient with babesiosis may be co-infected by Borrelia burgdorferi as the primary vector, Ixodes, is the same. This patient did not present with the usual erythema migrans, which is present in 90% of patients. Likewise, bradycardia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and elevated LDH are not common in this disease. Suspected cases should be treated without lab results with ten days of doxycycline.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Infection with Plasmodium falciparum leads to malaria and may present with very similar symptoms and lab results. This protozoa is transmitted by an infective female Anopheles mosquito vector, but has been eradicated from the United States. It is generally found in sub-Saharan Africa, which this patient was not exposed to this area. Paroxysms of fever, shaking chills, and sweats are also a common feature of this infection. The four drug classes currently used to treat malaria include quinoline compounds, antifolates, artemisinin derivatives, and antimicrobials.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Infection with Rickettsia rickettsii leads to Rocky Mountain spotted fever and is transmitted by the tick, Dermacentor variabilis.  Most cases are found in the southeast and south central regions.  The most common symptoms are fever greater than 102°F within three days after tick bite (94%), headache (86%), myalgias (85%), and CNS symptoms (25%). Up to 90% of patients develop a maculopapular rash with 43% demonstrating a rash on the palms and soles.  The drug of choice for treatment is doxycycline.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Infection with Salmonella typhi leads to typhoid fever, which is typically found in developing nations with poor sanitary conditions. Symptoms begin with fever after 7-14 days that follows a pattern characterized by a rising temperature each day that drops by the subsequent morning and plateaus after the first week. Accompanying this is gastrointestinal manifestations, dry cough, dull frontal headache, delirium, and malaise. During the second week of illness, the symptoms progress with the abdomen becoming distended. In the third week the fever continues and the patient becomes more toxic and with significant weight loss. Definitive treatment of typhoid fever is based on susceptibility, and generally includes fluoroquinolones.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Infection by Babesia microti should be suspected in cases where a person has been exposed to ticks especially in northeastern U.S. These patients will have flu-like symptoms and diagnosis can be confirmed with labs including increased LDH and peripheral blood smear demonstrating trophozoites in red blood cells.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/212605-overview" target="_search">"Babesiosis" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up with his oncologist. On review of symptoms the patient reports worsening&nbsp;fatigue and a recent fever that has persisted for one weeks' duration.&nbsp;He denies sick contacts, weight loss, or night sweats. Physical examination&nbsp;reveals enlarged, fixed axillary and abdominal lymph nodes. Lymph node biopsy&nbsp;reveals a monotonous infiltrate of small lymphocytes on one side with a pattern&nbsp;of diffuse large cells on the right. The most likely explanation for these&nbsp;findings is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute myelogenous leukemia</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">benign leukemoid reaction</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">infectious mononucleosis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Richter's transformation</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>Richter’s transformation (RT) is a complication of chronic&nbsp;lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or less commonly, Hairy cell leukemia, into a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of&nbsp;Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. &nbsp;RT should&nbsp;be suspected in patients with CLL who develop worsening B symptoms (fever,&nbsp;night sweats, and unintended weight loss) or rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy.&nbsp;Biopsy is required to make the diagnosis and histologic pattern exhibits&nbsp;diffuse large B cells. In this patient, the biopsy shows the pre-existing CLL,&nbsp;represented by the small lymphocytes, next to diffuse large B cells, which characterizes&nbsp;the transformation of CLL into a large B cell lymphoma.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a clonal proliferation of myeloid precursor cells with a reduced ability to differentiate into the mature cellular form. This accumulation of blasts or immature forms in the bone marrow and blood causes a variable reduction in the production of normal blood cells, platelets and mature granulocytes. AML typically affects older age adults with a median age of 65 years. Symptoms include general malaise and repeated infections and/or hemorrhagic findings from abnormal white and red blood cell counts as well as platelets. Enlarged lymph nodes are not a common finding. A bone marrow biopsy is necessary for a diagnosis. Immature cells such as myeloblasts are seen. Elongated clumps of granular material in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts called Auer rods are diagnostic. Auer rods and myeloblasts were not evident on this patient’s biopsy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A leukemoid reaction is an elevated white blood cell count (&gt;50,000). Leukemoid reactions are generally benign and typically in response to infection, drugs or from an underlying medical condition such as Diabetic Ketoacidosis. The peripheral blood smear shows a mix of mature neutrophil precursors in contrast to the immature forms seen in AML. This patient has a predominance of lymphocytes and large B cells making a leukemoid reaction less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical manifestation of the Ebstein Barr Virus (EBV). EBV is a widely disseminated herpes virus that is spread through oral secretions. Typical features include low-grade temperature, arthralgias, malaise, pharyngitis and cervical adenopathy. Given this patient’s immunocompromised state and lack of pharyngeal complaints, IM is a less likely diagnosis. The lymph node biopsy secures the diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a type of leukemia that affects B cell lymphocytes. CLL is the most common leukemia that occurs after the age of 50. Patients with CLL are often asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine blood work that reveals lymphocytosis (WBC 50,000-200,000). Diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral blood smear showing a predominance of mature, small lymphocytes. CLL can follow an indolent course and a patient may not need treatment. Patients with CLL have abnormal cellular and humoral-mediated immune responses and are at risk for infections. This patient may have developed an opportunistic infection but the lymph node biopsy and rapidly progressing lymph nodes make this a less likely diagnosis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Richter’s transformation should be suspected in&nbsp;a patient with CLL with worsening lymphadenopathy and B symptoms.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/199313-clinical" target="_search">Agabegi S, Agabegi E.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 22-year-old female presents to the office with questions concerning contraceptive options. History reveals she has just started a new relationship and they are planning to be sexually active in the near future. She has not had intercourse in the past and has never used contraceptives. She has no medical problems and takes no medications. She has a family history of a "blood disorder" and was told by her mother she should not take hormones. Her greatest concern is becoming pregnant and she would like the most effective contraceptive against pregnancy.&nbsp;Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/82 mmHg, a heart rate of 62/min, and respiratory rate of 18/min. Physical exam reveals a healthy appearing female with a regular rate and rhythm and clear breath sounds bilaterally. In addition to counseling the patient on the risk of STIs, the most appropriate recommendation is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">coitus interruptus</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">progestin implant</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">male condom</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">copper IUD</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">oral contraceptive pill</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>Copper IUDs are one of the most effective contraceptives on the market. They can stay in place for up to ten years and have a failure rate of less than 0.8%. The Copper IUD works by acting as a natural spermicide within the uterus, and is an excellent option for patients who cannot take hormones but desire long term contraception. &nbsp;<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Coitus interruptus is not a medically recommended contraceptive method as it has poor efficacy and involves the cessation of intercourse prior to ejaculation. It does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The progestin implant is the most effective form of reversible contraception with failure rates around 0.05%. However, the patient in this case has requested a non hormonal form of contraception.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The male condom has a failure rate of around 82% with typical use. It is effective at preventing some STIs.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The oral contraceptive pill has a failure rate of around 9%. It does not protect against STIs.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The copper IUD is a highly effective, non hormonal, reversible contraceptive.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Understand when to recommend different forms of contraception.&nbsp;</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/258507-overview" target="_search">"Contraception" on Medscape. </a><br><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/pdf/contraceptive_methods_508.pdf" target="_search">CDC</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 7/28/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with the complaint of dizziness. History reveals the dizziness has been happening off and on for the last 3 days and she also reports feeling fluttering in her chest. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg and a heart rate of 145/min. An ECG is obtained as shown in the exhibit. The most appropriate management is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">aspirin, morphine, nitroglycerine</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">procainamide</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">cardioversion</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">diltiazem</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">digoxin</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>The ECG shown is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and treatment is aimed at rate control. This is caused by rapid, disorderly firing from a second atrial focus, resulting in lack of coordinated atrial contractions with independent sporadic ventricular contractions. The medications of choice are calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers as well as anticoagulation (poor atrial contraction causes blood stasis, which leads to mural thrombi formation and a risk of embolization). If the patient had presented to the emergency room within 48 hours of onset then cardioversion could be an option. Since it has been at least 3 days there is a risk of thrombus formation in this patient who has not been anti-coagulated and cardioversion should be avoided.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Aspirin, morphine, and nitroglycerine are used for unstable angina or myocardial infarction (MI).  Unstable angina typically presents with worsening angina that occurs at rest, which is frequently caused by plaque rupture in the coronary arteries. ECG will show ST depression. An MI results in tissue death from ischemia caused by occlusion of the coronary vessels or vasospasm. ECG will show ST elevation in cases of an STEMI.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Procainamide is used for atrial fibrillation with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, where AV nodal blocking agents like calcium channel blockers should be avoided. WPW is caused by a separate accessory conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles and returns a conduction impulse to the AV node. ECG will show a delta wave and shortened PR. Amiodarone is another treatment option.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Cardioversion is used for unstable patients or patients within 48 hours of new-onset atrial fibrillation. Hemodynamic instability means systolic blood pressure &lt; 90, chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion. Patients experiencing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation may require electrical cardioversion. ECG will show a series of 3+ premature ventricular contractions with a heart rate of 160-240 (VT) and lack of ordered ventricular contraction, which leads to no cardiac output (v-fib), respectively.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Digoxin can be used adjunctively to treat atrial fibrillation, but is less effective for rate control than calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers. Digoxin slows the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation primarily by vagotonic inhibition of AV nodal conduction. In patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction and AF, digoxin has two potential benefits, reduction in the ventricular rate and improvement in contractility. However, since digoxin is less effective in rate control than beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers and has no ability to terminate AF, it should not be used as a first-line treatment. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, patients who have atrial fibrillation must be anticoagulated.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can be initially managed with diltiazem (calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers).<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Management of atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic, is a common topic on the COMLEX. Management of less common associations may be seen, such as rapid ventricular response (diltiazem) and Wolff-Parkinson-White (procainamide).</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151066-overview" target="_search">"Atrial fibrillation" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/24/2016</em></span>

Transudative effusions usually are due to a change in hydrostatic or oncotic pressure, as in conditions such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. The patient in the above scenario has pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure, which makes transudative fluid the correct statement.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; D &amp; E:</strong> This is characteristic of an exudative effusion.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This describes an exudative effusion. Exudative effusions are generally due to inflammation, such as an infectious or neoplastic process, and are characterized by a pleural to serum LDH ratio of &gt;0.6, a pleural to serum protein ratio &gt;0.5 and a total protein &gt;3 g/dL.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A pleural effusion qualifies as an exudate with the one or more of the following criteria: pleural to serum LDH ratio of &gt;0.6, pleural: serum protein ratio &gt;0.5, total protein &gt;3 g/dL, or pleural fluid LDH &gt;2/3 the normal upper limit of serum LDH.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Light's criteria are used to evaluate whether fluid from a pleural effusion is a transudate or exudate.

This patient meets all of these criteria for initiating this screening serologic testing. Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by the black-legged tick and is typically found in northeastern United States. Early localized disease typically includes a bullseye-like rash called erythema migrans and other nonspecific viral-like syndrome symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain and swelling, and fevers.

In approximately 80% of cases, the causative organism is Escherichia coli. The remainders of the cases are caused by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus and Pseudomonas species. The acutely inflamed prostate can cause fevers, rigors, dysuria, bacteriuria and a tense, tender prostate on exam. Voiding urgency and bladder outlet obstruction or retention is also common. Acute bacterial prostatitis is usually spontaneous but has been known to occur due to indwelling Foley catheters. First-line agents in the treatment of acute prostatitis are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Alternative antibiotics include ampicillin with gentamicin. Chronic prostatitis is less frequent and is more difficult to treat than the acute infection of the prostate. Chronic prostatitis is usually associated with low back pain or perineal pain. Rarely, some cases of prostatitis can lead to a prostatic abscess.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Amoxicillin-clavulanate is used to treat infections of the lower respiratory tract, otitis media, sinusitis, skin, urinary tract and bite wounds. It does cover Klebsiella and Enterobacter but these organisms are less likely causes of acute bacterial prostatitis.  The most likely causative organism is this patient is Escherichia coli for which amoxicillin-clavulanate is not an appropriate treatment option.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Ampicillin would be an appropriate answer if the patient had a known infection with Enterobacter species.  Post-massage urine or prostatic expressate can be cultured in patients with prostatitis to identify the causative organism.  Since 80% of acute bacterial prostatitis is caused by Escherichia coli, ampicillin is not the appropriate answer choice.  Ampicillin combined with gentamicin would be an appropriate treatment for empiric coverage of acute bacterial prostatitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Ceftriaxone and doxycycline would be appropriate medications for the treatment of epididymitis in a sexually active male less than 35 years old.  These medications cover Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis.  These organisms are not likely causes of acute bacterial prostatitis and therefore would not be the appropriate medication choice in this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Nitrofurantoin is a treatment option for urinary tract infections caused by organisms such as Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Klebsiella; however, it does not penetrate prostatic tissue and would not be an appropriate choice for this patient.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the first-line antibiotic for treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

This is an endocrinology emergency that occurs mainly in insulin-dependent diabetics. DKA presents with a positive anion gap metabolic acidosis. This patients anion gap is thirty as calculated by the following formula; Na - (Cl+HCO3). Patients with DKA are treated with fluids, insulin, and electrolyte repletion as necessary. As you give this patient insulin, potassium is driven into the intracellular space via the Na/K pump. Since total body potassium stores are typically depleted in DKA, this patient can have a significant and life threatening drop in her serum potassium level. Checking frequent potassium levels is required when treating DKA. Most hospitals have specialized order sets designed to avoid the life threatening complications of severe hypokalemia.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Patients experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis are frequently depleted of total body potassium stores. The patient likely has a significant acidosis as indicated by serum bicarbonate of 7 mEq/dL. Due to the Na/K pump, the relative amount of potassium is directly influenced by the amount of hydrogen ions in the serum. As the acidosis is corrected by insulin, potassium is driven into the intracellular space, thus lowering the serum potassium concentration.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This patient has hypochloremia now due to her anion-gap metabolic acidosis. As you correct with 0.9% sodium chloride, the chloride will return to normal concentration. Rarely is hyperchloremia of significant clinical influence.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The patient currently has pseudohyponatremia due to excessive glucose in the serum. This is corrected by calculating the corrected sodium by adding 1.8 x [glucose] &gt;100 to the measured sodium. As you correct this patient’s glucose with crystalloid infusion, the sodium should return to normal concentration.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The patient has a pseudohyponatremia from excessive glucose in the serum. As the serum glucose decreases, the serum sodium will increase.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hypokalemia is the most important electrolyte abnormality in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels is mandatory after starting insulin therapy.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Understanding potassium shifts is important in several areas of medicine. An easy way to remember that hypokalemia will occur when treating DKA with insulin is by remembering the treatment for hyperkalemia. Insulin or inhaled beta-agonists are used commonly to treat hyperkalemia. They work by driving extracellular potassium intracellularly, thus lowering serum potassium concentrations.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br>Ayala C, Spellberg B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Boards and Wards.</span> 4th Ed.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 70-year-old female presents to your office with complaint of a new tan-colored skin lesion. She first noticed the lesion several months ago when she was putting on her bra. She also noticed multiple similar tan lesions located below her right <span class="Highlight">breast</span>.

It has the characteristic “stuck-on appearance” with a well-circumscribed border. Upon palpation, the surface feels rough and will crumble if picked. SKs are more common with age and can occur on any hair-bearing surface. They usually occur on sun-exposed areas and underneath the breasts, where they can become red and irritated. Patients often believe these lesions are melanomas because of their tan to dark color and occasional irregular borders. SKs are usually of no clinical significance unless many erupt suddenly, which could be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. SKs themselves have no malignant potential and do not need removal, although they can be removed for cosmetic reasons, thus reassurance is the most appropriate answer.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Ketoconazole topical cream is an anti-fungal used for tinea infections and seborrheic dermatitis, not seborrheic keratosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A punch biopsy allows for visualization of the full skin thickness. Punch biopsies can be performed on a wide variety of skin conditions, including suspected squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. A punch biopsy is not necessary in this situation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Shave biopsy is used for skin lesions suspected to affect only the epidermis and dermis. If this lesion were in a cosmetically unfavorable location, such as the face, then a shave biopsy could be performed to remove the lesion. Since the patient is not bothered by their appearance, reassurance is the only necessary treatment.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A wide local excision is usually the treatment of choice for squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma. If the melanoma is &gt;1 mm depth, then a sentinel lymph node study must also be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Seborrheic Keratosis is a benign hyperplasia of basaloid epidermal cells with horn pseudocysts. SKs occur as dark brown to tan plaques or papules and have a characteristic stuck on appearance. Unless cosmetically unfavorable, reassurance is the best treatment choice.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Habif, TP. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Dermatology: A color guide to diagnosis and therapy</span>. 5th ed.

A common mnemonic to remember the prodrome symptoms of measles is the “3-C’s.” Cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis as well as Koplik spots (which may or may not be noted) are characteristic of measles in the early stage. Coryza is used to describe the symptoms of a cold such as nasal congestion. Koplik spots are red oral lesions with a white center. All of the above symptoms are prodromic and will disappear before the measles rash itself. Two to five days later the child will have a high fever with a maculopapular rash that begins on the face and spreads downward. The rash will last up to five days and resolve from the head downward. Measles is now a preventable disease due to the MMR live attenuated vaccine.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Chickenpox also can present with high fever but the characteristic pruritic rash first appears on the trunk and then spreads peripherally as a mixture of red papules that develop into clear vesicles. These vesicles then break and form scabs which tend to localize in a “cropped” pattern.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Fifth disease presents with the erythematous cheeks referred to as the "slapped cheeks" pattern. It subsequently forms an erythematous, pruritic, maculopapular rash that begins on the upper extremities and then spreads to the trunk in a reticular pattern.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Rubella (german measles) is caused by an RNA togavirus and presents as an erythematous maculopapular rash with generalized lymphadenopathy and low-grade fever.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Roseola is caused by human herpes virus six (HHV-6). It occurs in young children and presents as a high fever with no symptoms that resolves when the rash forms. It appears as a maculopapular rash on the trunk, which spreads peripherally.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Measles typically presents with symptoms of malaise, high fever, along with the three Cs (Cough, Coryza, and Conjunctivitis).<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/966220-overview" target="_search">"Measles" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

Patients with SSPE tend to be younger than 20 years of age, and SSPE develops about 7-10 years after having measles. There are multiple stages to the disease: Stage I lasts weeks to years and the patient develops insidious neurologic symptoms (eg: personality changes, lethargy), Stage II lasts three months to one year and is characterized by myoclonus, progressive dementia, and motor or sensory disease. In stage II patients maintain massive myoclonic jerks very frequently (as often as every 5-10 seconds). Stages III and IV are end-stages and are characterized by further neurologic deterioration, flaccidity or rigidity (usually decorticate), and autonomic dysfunction.&nbsp;Myoclonus is actually absent in these end-stages and death usually occurs in stage IV. Seizures can occur any time and some cases may go into temporary remission in between stages. Of note, this is a different entity than post-infectious encephalomyelitis which is thought to be of autoimmune origin and occurs much sooner after measles infection (usually within two weeks).<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; E:</strong> These conditions are not associated with measles.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal neurologic complication of measles that occurs years after the infection.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Medications used in the treatment or prevention of measles include vitamin A, antivirals (eg, ribavirin), measles virus vaccine, and human immunoglobulin.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/966220-overview" target="_search">"Measles" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

In Wilson disease the defect lies in copper transporting P-type ATPase due to autosomal recessive mutations in the ATP7B gene. Excess copper resulting from promotes free radical formation that results in oxidation of lipids and proteins. Initially copper accumulates in the liver, damaging hepatocytes and leading to cirrhosis. As serum copper levels increase, it deposits in other organs. The most common presentation of Wilson disease is cirrhosis and should be considered in any unexplained liver disease, especially in individuals under the age of 40 years. Other manifestations of Wilson disease include neuropsychiatric symptoms (difficulty speaking, excessive salivation, ataxia, masklike facies, clumsiness with the hands, and personality changes), osteoarthropathy with premature osteoarthritis, hemolytic anemia (Coombs-negative), and less commonly, renal impairment. Physical exam will reveal stigmata of cirrhosis (spider angiomas, ascites, palmar erythema) and ophthalmic exam may reveal Kayser-Fleischer rings. Kayser-Fleischer rings are greenish gold to brown in color and are formed by the deposition of copper in the Descemet membrane in the limbus of the cornea – usually only seen by slit lamp examination. The diagnosis of Wilson disease is made by serum ceruloplasmin levels less than 20 mg/dL; urinary copper excretion rate greater than 100 mg/day, and liver biopsy that demonstrates tissue copper levels of greater than 250 mcg/g of dry weight. Low alkaline phosphatase levels are also characteristic. Treatment includes chelation therapy with penicillamine, low copper diet, and liver transplantation (which is curative).<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> While depression with substance abuse is certainly possible with the presentation, the laboratory exam is more consistent with Wilson disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder leading to abnormal accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs, leading to organ toxicity. It is associated with high serum levels ferritin, transferrin, iron, and high transferrin saturation. Hemochromatosis is the most common inherited liver disease in white persons and the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorder.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that attacks myelinated axons in the central nervous system. The presentation of MS is highly variable but can include cognitive changes, ataxia, paresis, fatigue, and visual symptoms. Episodes of MS present months or years apart and in different anatomic locations. Characteristic brain imaging studies include periventricular white matter changes demonstrated by MRI.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Zinc deficiency is a nutritional deficiency associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle-cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and can also occur after bariatric surgery, and heavy metal exposure. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive disorder of zinc absorption seen in infants. Signs of zinc deficiency include diarrhea, anorexia, acne, and impairments in sight, taste, smell, and memory. While zinc deficiency can result in low alkaline phosphatase levels it is not associated with alterations in ceruloplasmin levels.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Wilson disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is characterized by cirrhosis and neuropsychiatric changes and is diagnosed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated copper excretion, and identification of Kayser-Fleischer rings.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/183456-overview" target="_search">"Wilson Disease" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/22/2016</em></span>

This common dermatitis appears to be worse in many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and is also very common and severe in patients with HIV/AIDS. In general, symptoms are worse in the winter. Treatment included Selenium sulfide shampoo to the affected areas and topical steroids for severe disease.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a disease characterized by chronic skin inflammation which is atopic, hereditary, and non-contagious. The skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis reacts abnormally and easily to irritants, food, and environmental allergens and becomes red, flaky and extremely pruritic, opening the skin up to potential infection. The skin on the flexural surfaces of the joints (for example inner sides of elbows and knees) are most commonly affected.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Pityriasis rosea typically presents as numerous patches of pink or red that are oval in shape and are most commonly seen on the torso. A single, large red "herald" patch may occur 1 to 20 days before smaller, more numerous patches are witnessed.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Psoriasis also affects the skin and joints. The scaly patches caused by psoriasis, called psoriatic plaques, are areas of inflammation and excessive skin production.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor) is associated when the skin becomes infected with Malassezia furfur. Generally oval or irregularly shaped spots of 0.5 to 2.5 cm in diameter, often merging together to form a larger patch, these spots are most commonly seen on the back, armpit, chest, lower legs, and neck. Occasionally it can be seen on the face.

The foregut is from the oral cavity to the proximal 1/2 of the 2nd portion of the duodenum (the descending portion) at the position of the major papilla (otherwise known as the ampulla of Vater and entry of the common bile duct). The midgut extends from this point of the duodenum to the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon. Of note, some anatomic references consider the splenic flexure to be the end of the midgut. The hindgut continues from this point to the rectum. Studies have shown that the color and consistency of stool is not sensitive or specific enough to confidently identify the location of a GI bleed. The most definitive step in the diagnosis of this patient would be some form of endoscopy (i.e. EGD, Pill-cam, and/or colonoscopy).<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The esophagus is part of the foregut, which receives innervation from T5-9.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The stomach is part of the foregut, which receives innervation from T5-9.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The sigmoid colon is part of the hindgut, which receives innervation from T12-L2.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The splenic flexure is part of the hindgut, which receives innervation from T12-L2.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Gastrointestinal bleeding is a very common cause of anemia in the elderly population.

It is estimated that PUD accounts for 30-40% of UGIB. Upper GI bleeding occurs from a source proximal to the ligament of Treitz. Symptoms can include hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, and fatigue due to blood loss, light-headedness, and syncope. Peptic ulcer disease is highly correlated with Helicobacter pylori infection, which creates disruption of the gastric mucosa and ulcerations.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 38-year-old G1P0 female at <span class="Highlight">8 weeks' gestation</span> is scheduled to undergo fetal karyotyping via <span class="Highlight">chorionic villous sampling</span>. Despite the recommended gestational age of 9 to 11 weeks for the procedure, the patient is adamant to have the testing done today. The most appropriate advice regarding risk to the fetus for performing the procedure at this time is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">increased risk for limb abnormalities</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">increased risk for premature rupture of membranes</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">increased risk for preterm labor</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">no increased risk</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">significantly increased risk for fetal death</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>Chorionic villous sampling (CVS) can be utilized sooner than amniocentesis to assess fetal karyotype and is typically performed between 9 and 11 weeks gestation. CVS involves transcervical or transabdominal aspiration of placental chorionic villi tissue. The advantage of using it is that it has a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of amniocentesis while the disadvantage of it is that it carries a risk of limb reduction or, less commonly, fetal loss and it cannot detect open neural tube defects. Amniocentesis is performed at 15-20 weeks, and it consists of transabdominal aspiration of amniotic fluid using ultrasound guided needle evaluation of fetal cells for genetic studies.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Although PROM is a potential complication of the procedure, performing CVS prior to 9 weeks gestation specifically places the fetus at in increased risk for limb abnormalities.  PROM presents with a sudden gush of fluid from the vagina.  It can be diagnosed using the fern or nitrazine tests.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Although preterm labor is a potential complication of the procedure, performing CVS prior to 9 weeks gestation specifically places the fetus at in increased risk for limb abnormalities. This is thought to be due to vascular interruption that occurs during the procedure.  Fetal fibronectin can be used to predict the probability of preterm labor.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The patient is at an increased risk by having the procedure done and increased risk for having it done early.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Although fetal death is a drastic potential complication of the procedure, performing CVS prior to 9 weeks gestation specifically places the fetus at in increased risk for limb abnormalities.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Patients who undergo CVS prior to 9 weeks gestation are at most increased risk for the risk of fetal limb abnormalities.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Amniocentesis, chorionic villous sampling, PUBS, and fluorescent in-situ hybridization should be reviewed prior to test day.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 67-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a two-hour history of bloody emesis. History reveals the episodes began spontaneously this morning. After the episodes, the patient felt dizzy and stumbled but denies falling or losing consciousness. He denies any previous history of hematemesis. He has a history of hepatitis C virus related cirrhosis and is currently on the liver transplantation list. Vitals reveal a blood pressure of 76/40 mmHg, a heart rate of 115/min, a temperature of 37.1°C, and a respiratory rate of 15/min. Physical examination reveals the patient's skin is yellow in color and his sclerae are icteric. There is shifting abdominal dullness, and increased deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit, volume repleted, given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and started on intravenous ceftriaxone and octreotide. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy&nbsp;(EGD) is performed and reveals actively bleeding esophageal varices. Which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated in this patient for prevention of recurrence?</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">alpha 1 blockade</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">alpha 2 blockade</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">beta 1 blockade</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">both alpha and beta blockade</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">nonselective beta blockade</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>This patient has actively bleeding gastroesophageal varices, which is one of the most significant complications of portal hypertension. Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension, as seen in the patient who has cirrhosis secondary to his chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Portal hypertension is the result of splanchnic vasodilation leading to increased splanchnic blood flow in combination with an increased resistance to blood flow secondary to the intrahepatic fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction present in a cirrhotic liver. The increase pressure gradient distends&nbsp;the veins proximal to the site of obstruction, which leads to the gastroesophageal varices. <br> <br> The lifetime risk in a cirrhotic for a variceal bleed is approximately 30% with an associated mortality risk of 30% to 50%, making prophylaxis essential. Current guidelines recommend that all patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis undergo endoscopic screening for gastroesophageal varices. Prophylaxis should be initiated if large varices are noted and has been shown to decrease the risk of an esophageal bleed by 30% to 40%. Nonselective beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, are the drugs of choice for prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Nonselective beta-blockers block adrenergic dilatory tone in mesenteric arterioles which results in unopposed alpha-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction and therefore a decrease in portal inflow. In patients, such as this one, who has already had a variceal bleed, esophageal band ligation is recommended in addition to a nonselective beta blockade.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Alpha 1 blockers include medications such as alfuzosin, prazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin. This class of drugs is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Alpha 2 blockers such as mirtazapine are used for depression. Known side effects of the drug are sedation, increased appetite, and increased serum cholesterol.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Beta 1 blockers such as atenolol are mainly used for the treatment of hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This medication decreases heart rate and preload. In contrast to nonselective beta-blockers, the medication does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not produce neurologic side effects.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Both alpha and beta blockade is accomplished with drugs such as labetalol. They are used for treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension as well as chronic hypertension secondary to pheochromocytoma.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Nonselective beta-blockers, such as propranolol and nadolol, are the preferred pharmacologic agents for prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage. In patients who have already had a variceal bleed; prophylaxis included endoscopic esophageal band ligation in addition to a nonselective beta-blocker.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis" target="_search">"Prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis" on UpToDate.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/22/2016</em></span>

Subacute endocarditis occurs in patients that have underlying valve abnormalities. This diagnosis can be made by the following Duke criteria. Major criteria include positive blood cultures growing common organisms, positive echocardiogram or onset of new heart murmur. Minor criteria include the presence of a predisposing valve abnormality, fever, embolic disease, immunologic phenomena such as roth spots, osler nodes, and janeway lesions, or one positive blood culture with a rare organism. In order to make the diagnosis two major criteria, or one major and three minor, or five minor criteria need to be apparent. The most common etiology for subacute endocarditis includes Streptococcus viridans and Staphlococcus epidermidis. Of these Staphlococcus epidermidis is a gram positive, catalase positive, and coagulase negative organism that can cause prosthetic valve endocarditis.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Staphlococcus aureus is the most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis.

This type of personality disorder is uncommon in clinical settings. A person with this disorder is markedly detached from others and has little desire for close relationships. This person's life is marked by little pleasure in activities. People with this disorder appear indifferent to the praise or criticism of others and often seem cold or aloof.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Avoidant personality disorder also shares some of these features; however, patients also demonstrate feelings of inadequacy and are in constant fear of being ridiculed by peers or other members of society. Unlike people with schizoid personality disorder, those with avoidant personality disorder desperately want to have friends.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Patients with borderline personalities demonstrate extreme "black and white" thinking, known as “splitting” and have instability in mood, interpersonal relationships, and sense of self. Borderline pathology in children refers to a syndrome characterized by a combination of externalizing symptoms (disruptive behavioral problems), internalizing symptoms (mood and anxiety symptoms), and cognitive symptoms.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> There is no sign of dependence on other people.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Schizotypal personality disorder is associated with “weird” behavior characterized by unconventional beliefs such as being convinced of having extra sensory abilities. The above patient is not demonstrating any signs of “odd” or “strange” behavior.  People with this disorder exhibit marked eccentricities of thought, perception, and behavior.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Patients suffering from schizoid personality disorder are “loners” contented with being alone.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 68-year-old female presents to the emergency department with the complaint of abdominal pain for 5 days' duration. History reveals her last bowel movement was 3 days ago and she is experiencing nausea and vomiting. She denies fever or chills. Past surgical history is significant for 2 cesarean sections and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs with a diffusely tender abdomen, decreased bowel sounds and a non-reducible, mid-line abdominal mass above the umbilicus.

            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">incarcerated hernia</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">incisional hernia</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">paraesophageal hernia</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">strangulated hernia</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">umbilical hernia</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>The patient is presenting with symptoms of a small bowel obstruction secondary to an incarcerated ventral hernia. Ventral hernias are found in the midline of the abdomen and occur when a defect in the transversus abdominal fascia occurs allowing a hole through which bowel herniates. If the loop of bowel becomes trapped within the defect and cannot be reduced, it is termed an "incarcerated" hernia. If the blood supply to an incarcerated portion of bowel becomes compromised, it is termed a "strangulated" hernia which requires emergent operative reduction and repair of the defect with possible resection of the involved bowel.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> An incisional hernia occurs when a portion of bowel herniates through a previous surgical scar. While this patient's hernia could have resulted from scars left by prior surgeries, the hernia is clearly not reducible and thus the best answer choice is incarcerated hernia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A paraesophageal hernia is a type of hiatal hernia which occurs when the fundus of the stomach herniates through the diaphragm.  This type of hernia is not palpated in the abdominal midline.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A strangulated hernia occurs when the blood supply to the portion of trapped bowel becomes compromised causing necrosis of the bowel.  Patients generally present very ill with fever and chills as well as laboratory abnormalities such as lactic acidosis and electrolyte derangements due to the necrotic bowel. This requires emergent surgical intervention with possible bowel resection if necrosis is clearly present. <br>
<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> An umbilical hernia is a form of midline hernia where bowel herniates through the umbilicus, whereas this patient presents with a hernia superior to the umbilicus. Umbilical hernias can be present normally in children up to 2 years of age after which most spontaneously reduce.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Incarcerated hernias consist of a loop of non-reducible bowel which has an intact blood supply and patients often have normal vitals and labs, unlike those with a strangulated hernia.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

Oral lichen planus is often asymptomatic, as seen in this case, and presents as fine, white, lacelike lines again referred to as Wickham's striae.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer, yet it accounts for less than 0.1% of patient deaths due to cancer. Patients presenting with BCC often report a slowly enlarging lesion that does not heal and that bleeds intermittently. As tumors most commonly occur on the face, patients often give a history of an acne bump that occasionally bleeds. Consider BCC in any patient with a history of a sore on sun-exposed skin that does not heal, especially if it has central ulceration with rolled edges.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma carries a variable clinical course ranging from minimal mucocutaneous disease to widespread organ involvement.  The lesions may involve the skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes, and visceral organs.  Most patients present with cutaneous findings that are classically red to purple macules, papules, and nodules.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (50%), which has led some authors to use this term synonymously with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. MF is a malignant lymphoma characterized by the expansion of a clone of CD4+ (or helper) memory T cells that normally patrol and home to the skin. Various stages of MF include patch, plaque, or tumoral. The patch phase is characterized by flat, erythematous patches that may have a fine scale and may be pruritic. The plaques tend to be raised with fine scale. Annular or serpiginous patterns with central clearing are common. The tumoral stage may present with non-tender, erythematous to brown nodules or tumors.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Psoriasis is a chronic, non-contagious, inflammatory disorder. Many patients with psoriasis have a familial predisposition for the illness, which most commonly manifests itself on the skin of the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, and intergluteal cleft. Classically, psoriasis appears as well demarcated erythematous plaques with thick silvery scale. The joints can also be affected by psoriasis in up to 35% of patients with the disease.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Lichen planus classically presents as flat-topped, purpuric, polygonal, pruritic papules on the wrists and flexor extremities.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1123213-overview " target="_search">Lichen Planus on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/24/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 39-year-old male who is employed as a carpenter presents to the outpatient office for evaluation of left wrist pain and reduced grip strength. History reveals that the patient is left hand dominant with&nbsp;pain over the dorsum of the wrist. There is no report of paresthesias into the fingers and the patient states, "I don't remember my&nbsp;hand ever falling asleep." The patient cannot recall any recent trauma to the affected wrist although he does subject his hand to repetitive motions on an almost daily basis. Evaluation reveals tenderness on palpation over the dorsal wrist. There is no pain with examination of the metacarpals or phalanges. Range of motion testing is significant for reduced extension and flexion at the wrist joint. Finkelstein test, Allen test and Watson test are found to be negative. Plain radiographs obtained in the office demonstrate degenerative changes around the lunate. The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is</div><br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 3-year-old male presents to the emergency department by ambulance with his mother who reports the patient had a seizure lasting one minute. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 40 ºC (104 ºF), a blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, a heart rate of 150/min, and a respiratory rate of 30/min. Physical examination reveals an alert and oriented, well-developed male in no distress. There is clear nasal discharge and watery, clear eye discharge bilaterally. The tympanic membranes are visualized and are normal in appearance. Neurologic examination is unremarkable and Brudzinski&nbsp;and Kernig signs are negative. The most appropriate initial management is</div><br>

They occur with rapid rise of temperature during a febrile illness. Simple febrile seizures are defined as lasting less than fifteen minutes, generalized (generalized clonic or generalized tonic-clonic), and occurring only once in a 24-hour time period. This patient is the appropriate age for a simple febrile seizure. A postictal state is common but should resolve as it did in this scenario. Fever should be reduced with antipyretics and a child &gt; 18 months of age can be safely discharged from the emergency department with no further workup and supportive care only. Parental reassurance is necessary, as seizures are a frightening event. Children with simple febrile seizures have a 30% chance of having another febrile seizure. A simple febrile seizure increases the chance of the patient developing epilepsy later in life from 1% (general population) to 2%.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This patient had a simple febrile seizure and further laboratory or radiographic workup is not recommended in children over 18-months-old. Neuroimaging should be reserved for children with complex febrile seizures, defined as a seizure occurring in the setting of a febrile illness that lasts over fifteen minutes, is focal, or occurs more than once in a 24-hour period. In addition to brain CT, patients with complex febrile seizures require further workup including laboratory testing and lumbar puncture.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Blood cultures are unlikely to be of any benefit in a patient with a simple febrile seizure and are not recommended. If there is concern for fever source or other indications for a sepsis workup, further testing is warranted. In this case however, the patient is likely febrile from acute viral syndrome and is the appropriate age for a simple febrile seizure.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> In simple febrile seizures, lumbar puncture is strongly recommended for patients &lt; 12-months-old and should be considered in those 12 to 18-months-old. In this age group, children may lack classic physical exam findings for CNS infection. Otherwise, CNS infection should only be investigated with lumbar puncture in a child if there are signs or symptoms such as altered mental status, meningismus, bulging anterior fontanelle, or abnormal finding on neurologic examination. This patient is 3-years old and has no meningeal signs and a normal neurologic examination, therefore a lumbar puncture is not recommended.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated when there is a suspicion of bacteremia and sepsis and if there is a source of infection. This patient has signs of a viral infection. In addition, he is mentating normally and has no signs of neurologic infection. Tachycardia is common in fever, and this patient has a normal blood pressure for his age. The tachycardia should resolve with defervescence and further workup is warranted if it does not. Therefore, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be beneficial in the initial course of this patient’s presentation.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Simple febrile seizures are common in children ages 6 months to 5 years, initial management includes antipyretics and supportive care.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1176205-overview" target="_search">"Febrile Seizures" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/26/2016</em></span>

Thiazide diuretics have been shown to cause several metabolic effects including hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Their use can also can result in metabolic syndrome, which is defined as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Thiazides are known to precipitate gout attacks due to increased reabsorption of urate and decreased excretion of urate resulting in hyperuricemia. Loop diuretics are also known to cause hyperuricemia and can precipitate gout flares.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Thiazides cause hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia by increasing the reabsorption of calcium in the proximal tubule.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A healthy 10-year-old male presents to the summer camp clinic with a pruritic rash.

Treatment involves avoidance of triggers, keeping the skin moist with lotions, topical steroids, and antihistamines for symptomatic relief.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by the fungus <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em>. Inoculation of the fungus into the skin or subcutaneous tissue is common in people with exposure to soil containing the fungus. The lymphocutaneous form is the most common type that begins days to weeks after initial inoculation. First, a papule develops at the site, which may ulcerate and have overlying erythema. Drainage from the lesion can occur, but is not grossly purulent and usually odorless. Lesions similar in presentation can develop along lymphatic channels proximal to the original lesion. Culture is the gold standard for diagnosis with oral Itraconazole the treatment of choice for uncomplicated infections.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Herpes zoster presents in a dermatomal pattern, which is not consistent with the rash described in the above scenario.  Most people have a prodromal pain in the same area anywhere from days to weeks before the rash erupts.  Pain is typically described as burning or stabbing pain, and can be quite severe.  The rash begins as erythematous papules that progressively develop into grouped vesicles or bullae.  Within a couple of days, these lesions can become more pustular or hemorrhagic in nature.  Close monitoring should be applied for immunocompromised patients and those with lesions involving the eye.  Anti-viral therapy started within the first 48-72 hours of onset of rash has demonstrated benefit in lessening the severity and duration of pain, promoting more rapid healing of skin lesions, preventing new lesion formation, decreasing viral shedding to reduce the risk of transmission, and preventing post-herpetic neuralgia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Tinea corporis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal (dermatophyte) infection that most commonly affects the torso.  KOH preparation will demonstrate segmented hyphae and arthrospores, which are the typical findings of dermatophyte infections.  Characteristic features include pruritic, circular, erythematous, patches that are scaling or plaque like.  First line treatment is with a topical anti-fungal.  While this patient is presenting with signs of a fungal infection, the quantity and location of lesions is unusual.  Likewise, the KOH preparation is negative for hyphae, which excludes this diagnosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Bartonellosis is an infection common associated with the microorganism <em>Bartonella henselae</em>, but can refer to other infections by the species in the Bartonella genus.  The common microbe in the U.S. is typically transmitted through inoculation by an infected cat, thus the common name of Cat Scratch Fever.  Typical manifestation is regional swollen lymph nodes with overlying erythema, which is occasionally suppurative.  Disseminated disease is not common, but can be life threatening.  Azithromycin is the common choice for treatment.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Rhus dermatitis is allergic contact dermatitis typically due to the allergenic substance urushiol from poison ivy and related plants.

It classically presents with pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulder girdle, and/or hips. Because of the pain in the shoulders and/or hips, patients will often complain of difficulty combing their hair and/or rising from a chair. Systemic symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, depression, and fever may occur in as many as 50% of patients. Common laboratory findings include a normocytic, normochromic anemia, a normal creatine kinase, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (often &gt;40 mm/hr), and an elevated serum interleukin-6 which parallels the inflammatory activity. Autoantibody markers including antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and anti-cyclic&nbsp;citrullinated peptide are often normal.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cervical radiculopathy would be more likely if the patient was complaining of radiating numbness, tingling, or electric-like pain from her neck to her shoulder or down into her arm.  This patient also complains of pain and stiffness bilaterally which, although does not exclude radiculopathy, makes it less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Fibromyalgia is described as chronic widespread tenderness and pain and is most common in younger to middle-aged women.  The typical syndrome consists of persistent widespread pain and tenderness of greater than three months' duration, stiffness, fatigue and sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties.  Physical examination is typically normal with the exception of tenderness.   It is thought to be a multifactorial disturbance in central pain processing.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Laboratory testing is usually normal.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Impingement syndrome is caused by a reduction of the subacromial space and impingement on the structures that pass through which include the supraspinatus, long head of the bicep tendon, and the subacromial bursa.  Physical exam reveals reproduction of pain with the Neer and Hawkins impingement tests during which the tendons are compressed between the coracoacromial arch and the humeral head.  The most common cause for impingement syndrome is anatomic variation in the coracoacromial arch.  Fatigue from overuse and weakness may also contribute.  Laboratory evaluation would be normal.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Polymyositis is another chronic inflammatory disease, which can be easily confused with polymyalgia rheumatica. This disease, however, causes symmetric proximal muscle weakness, and the muscles are usually painless. Weakness usually develops over three to six months. Diagnostic studies reveal leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, positive rheumatoid factor (&gt;50% of patients), and an elevated creatine kinase. The elevated creatine kinase and rheumatoid factor can help to distinguish this from polymyalgia rheumatica.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Polymyalgia rheumatica presents in middle to older aged people with proximal muscle stiffness and pain.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><br>

It typically responds very well to even low dose steroids. The steroids do not, however, alter the natural course of polymyalgia rheumatica and relapses are common. Patients are typically started on prednisone 15 mg/day with a very slow, prolonged taper over the following months. If, however, there is no improvement within the first week, steroids may be increased and an alternate diagnosis should be suspected. Calcium and vitamin D should also be started when initiating corticosteroid treatment. Continued activity is recommended, as activity restriction is unnecessary. For patients who do not respond quickly with corticosteroid treatment, physical therapy may be initiated.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Systemic steroids are needed to treat polymyalgia rheumatica.  Corticosteroid injections are useful in the treatment of various other musculoskeletal conditions where only a local effect is needed such as impingement syndrome and osteoarthritis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hydrocodone is a narcotic analgesic with significant abuse potential.  It is not recommended here, as the symptoms tend to respond very well and very rapidly to systemic steroids.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> This patient has no evidence of radicular symptoms or neurologic involvement and thus has no indication for surgical intervention.  Also, there is no mention of neurodiagnostic imaging in the question stem as would be required before a neurosurgical procedure would be planned.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Although physical therapy may seem like an appealing choice, and can often be a beneficial adjunctive therapy for any neuromusculoskeletal disorder, systemic steroids is the treatment of choice and should not be delayed for initiation of physical therapy.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Oral steroids are the first line treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 64-year-old male presents with the complaint of sinus congestion and headache for three days' duration. He also admits to a ten-pound weight loss and increased fatigue for three months' duration. History reveals he has been treated for sinusitis four times in the last year, and is being treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His medications include simvastatin and lisinopril. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 135/88 mmHg, a heart rate of 94/min, and a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F). Physical examination is significant for a saddle nose deformity and palpable purpura of the lower extremities. Laboratory analysis reveals a positive c-ANCA.

It presents with constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise and weight loss as well as upper airway symptoms including recurrent sinusitis and saddle nose deformities. It can also lead to lower airway symptoms such as hemoptysis. It is characterized by a positive c-ANCA.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Eosinophilia is seen in Churg-Strauss, which is characterized by a triad of asthma, eosinophilia and necrotizing vasculitis. Like Wegener's granulomatosis, it also may cause sinusitis, but does not cause the saddle nose deformity characteristic of Wegener's.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Gummas in the liver are seen in tertiary syphilis but may be found anywhere throughout the body.

Since somatic dysfunctions are named for their ease, a rib that moves easily into exhalation but not into inhalation will be diagnosed as an exhalation dysfunction. The posterior scalene aids in respiration and elevates the 2nd rib during forced inhalation. Directing muscle energy techniques to the posterior scalene will bring the 2nd rib into its inhalation restrictive barrier.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B:</strong> The anterior and middle scalenes attach to the 1st rib. Treating these muscles with muscle energy would address an exhalation dysfunction of the 1st rib.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The pectoralis minor muscles attach to ribs 3-5 and are effective in treating exhalation dysfunctions of those ribs.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) is an accessory muscle of respiration. However, it attaches to the clavicle and manubrium and would not be effective in treating a rib dysfunction.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The posterior scalene attaches to the 2nd rib and is utilized in muscle energy techniques to treat exhalation dysfunctions involving the second rib.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>It is extremely likely that you will face at least one or two questions dealing with rib dysfunctions.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with multiple burns. History reveals the patient is a firefighter and was trapped in a burning building while responding to a call. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), a blood pressure of 155/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 100/min, a respiratory rate of 26/min, an oxygen saturation of 88% on high-flow oxygen, and a weight of 100 kg. Physical examination reveals a confused male in respiratory distress with an estimated 50% total body surface area of partial and full thickness burns. There is soot throughout his mouth, singed nasal passages, and mild oropharyngeal edema. The correct amount of resuscitative fluids with 0.9% sodium chloride to administer to this patient in the first 8 hours is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">1,000 mL</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">1,120 mL</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">2,000 mL</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">10,000 mL</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">20,000 mL</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>Intravenous fluids are incredibly important in resuscitation of burn patients. The appropriate fluids are 0.9% NaCl or Lactated Ringers. Fluid resuscitation should follow the Parkland formula, which is: 4 mL x %TBSA x weight (kg) = mL fluid over 24 hours. Note that the TBSA (total body surface area of burn) only includes 2nd degree (partial thickness) and 3rd degree (full thickness) burns. Once the total volume is calculated, half of this volume should be given in the first 8 hours, and the second half over the following 16 hours. In this calculation: 4 mL x 50 (%TBSA) x 100 kg= 20,000 mL. Divide by 2, and 10,000 mL (10 L) should be given in the first 8 hours. The Parkland formula determines how much fluid should be given in addition to maintenance fluids.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; C:</strong> See answer explanation for formula. 1 or 2 L is much too little fluid. This answer should not make intuitive sense, as this is a large burn, a large patient, and a small fluid volume.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Using the maintenance fluid calculation for children, one can come up with 140 mL/hr x 8 hrs = 1120 mL. This is the 4:2:1 rule: 4 mL/kg for the first 10 kg, plus 2 mL/kg for the next 10 kg, plus 1 mL/kg for each remaining kg of a child’s weight. This formula estimates the appropriate maintenance fluids for children, not burn patients.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> This is the correct amount of total fluid to be given over the first 24 hours. Remember that ½ should be given over the first 8 hours and the second half over the remaining 16 hours.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Fluid resuscitation in adult burns should follow the Parkland formula, which is: 4 mL x %TBSA x weight (kg) = mL fluid over 24 hours, half of which is given in the first 8 hours.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>On level 2-CE, the most critical knowledge when it comes to burns are 1) Airway management issues 2) Fluids per Parkland formula 3) Calculating % TBSA. If you know these three concepts, you will fly through any burn question.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/435402-overview#aw2aab6b3" target="_search">"Initial Evaluation and Management of the Burn Patient" on Medscape.  </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 65-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of burning epigastric pain at night. History reveals the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is noncompliant with lifestyle modifications. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region without rebound or guarding. An endoscopy is performed as shown in the exhibit. The following finding will most likely be found on biopsy.</div><br>

Barrett's esophagus is defined as columnar metaplasia of the squamous cells in the esophagus. The changes can be clearly seen on endoscopy, however a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with Barrett's esophagus are at a higher risk for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and should be treated with proton pump inhibitors as well as lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle modifications include avoiding foods that decrease the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter such as caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol, as well as elevating the head of the bed at night.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Barrett's esophagus is the precursor to adenocarcinoma, but is itself benign. This patient has no symptoms indicating adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which would include difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and night sweats.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Inflammation is seen in esophagitis, not Barrett's. Esophagitis may be due to swallowing a chemical irritant.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Squamous cell dysplasia is the precursor to squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs in the upper esophagus usually due to smoking. Lower esophageal cancer due to longstanding GERD forms as adenocarcinoma.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Metaplasia is the transformation of one type of differentiated cell into another type of differentiated cell. Since squamous cells are the normal type of cell that lines the esophagus, squamous metaplasia is impossible in the esophagus.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Barrett's esophagus is columnar metaplasia of squamous cells.

            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">renal artery stenosis</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Crohn's disease</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Churg-Strauss syndrome</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">polyarteritis nodosa</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute pancreatitis</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries that most commonly involves the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although there are many manifestations of PAN, it should be considered in all patients presenting with symptoms including fever, malaise, weight loss, and anorexia. Peripheral or central nervous symptoms, dermatologic findings (vascular purpura, subcutaneous nodules, and livedo reticularis), myalgias, and orchitis are also possible presenting signs of PAN. Approximately 20% of patients with classic PAN are positive for p-ANCA. According the American College of Rheumatology, the diagnosis of PAN can be made if the patient has 3 of the 10 following signs: 1. Weight loss greater than/equal to 4 kg 2. Livedo reticularis, which appears as a mottled, purple discoloration over the extremities or torso 3. Testicular pain in males (orchitis) 4. Myalgias or weakness 5. Elevated BUN and creatinine 6. Hepatitis-positive serology 7. Central or peripheral neuropathy 8. Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg 9. Arteriogram showing aneurysms in small or medium-sized vessels 10. Biopsy-positive tissue<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is typically due to atherosclerotic disease or fibromuscular dysplasia, and most often presents with accelerated or hard to control hypertension.  Other features that may indicate RAS include: onset of hypertension at an age younger than 30 or older than 55, decreasing renal function with initiation of a renin-angiotensin blocker, an abdominal bruit and recurrent flash pulmonary edema.  Presence of renal artery narrowing does not necessarily indicate clinical consequences.  Imaging will reveal narrowing of the renal arteries.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> In cases of Crohn’s disease look for patients complaining of crampy abdominal pain that is relieved with defecation. Symptoms of Crohn's are typically chronic in nature, unlike in the above case. Furthermore, Crohn's would not explain many of the findings in this patient such as the aneurysms and fevers.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Churg-Strauss syndrome is a vasculitis affecting small vessels that is associated with asthma and eosinophilia.  The classic presentation is the triad of eosinophilia, granulomatous inflammation, and vasculitis.  Laboratory studies may reveal a positive perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO). Treatment is with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Acute pancreatitis is most commonly elicited by gallstones or alcohol ingestion. Severe upper abdominal pain, with radiation to the back, is one of the hallmark findings of acute pancreatitis, although nausea and vomiting are usually present as well.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Polyarteritis nodosa is a vasculitis of small and medium-size vessels that presents with a vast array of signs/symptoms involving the skin, joints, peripheral nerves, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/330717-overview" target="_search"><br>

There are no specific lab tests for diagnosing polyarteritis nodosa.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be elevated in cases of polyarteritis nodosa. However, an elevated ESR indicates inflammation in general and is not a sensitive test.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Ultrasound is not useful for diagnosis of this disease. CT angiography should be performed, as was done in the case, to evaluate for medium vessel aneurysms. Ultrasound will not give adequate information to identify these aneurysms.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) are less commonly found in polyarteritis nodosa patients.

These questions tend to be very common when dealing with GI disorders but pop up in other systems as well. For example, everyone knows that abdominal ultrasound is the best screening test for acute cholecystitis. Another favorite question asks the confirmatory test (or the definitive test) for pulmonary embolism, which is pulmonary angiography.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes presents to the office with the complaint of <span class="Highlight">weakness for four months’ duration</span>. History reveals difficulty ambulating and accomplishing tasks that are progressively worsening. The patient reports falling three times in the past week and yesterday, he developed difficulty swallowing. Physical examination reveals an elderly male in no acute distress. Neurological examination reveals decreased strength, stiffness, and hyperreflexia of the lower extremities bilaterally. The upper extremities are twitching with atrophy and decreased reflexes but sensation is normal. The most appropriate treatment is</div><br>

It affects lower motor neurons that reside in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and in the brain stem, corticospinal upper motor neurons that reside in the precentral gyrus, and prefrontal motor neurons that are involved in planning or orchestrating the work of the upper and lower motor neurons. Loss of lower motor neurons leads to progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). Loss of corticospinal upper motor neurons may produce stiffness (spasticity), abnormally active reflexes, and pathological reflexes. Loss of prefrontal neurons may result in special forms of cognitive impairment that include, most commonly, executive dysfunction. The classic form of sporadic ALS usually starts as dysfunction or weakness in one part of the body and spreads gradually within that part and then to the rest of the body. Ventilatory failure results in death, on average, three years after the onset of focal weakness. The only FDA approved medication for ALS is riluzole (brand name Rilutek). This medication has been proven to retard progression of the disease and increase the number of days to ventilator dependence. However, it only extends life expectancy by two to three months and is quite expensive. It should be prescribed on a case-by-case basis after careful discussion with the family and his or her family.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Doxycycline and the other medications listed (among many others) have all been studied as possible treatments for ALS. None other than riluzole has shown to extend life expectancy. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. It is frequently used in atypical pneumonia and Lyme disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> IVIG is thought to be effective in treatment of autoimmune diseases such as Guillain Barre Syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Use in ALS has not been shown to be effective.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Prednisone is an anti-inflammatory medication and is used extensively in a number of other neurologic and medical diseases. Again though, it has not been proven to be effective in treatment of ALS.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B cells. It is an immune modulating medication. It is widely used in hematologic cancers, rheumatologic disorders and autoimmune diseases. Neurologically it is sometimes used in autoimmune encephalitis, and neuromyelitis optica. It is not been proven to work in ALS.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Clinically definite ALS involves upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in at least three body segments. Riluzole is the only FDA approved medication for ALS.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em><em>ALS is a somewhat rare disease and you are unlikely to be questioned about it in detail. Make sure to review that basic presentation, testing and treatment, but do not get bogged down in particulars. Remember that exams will ask about typical presentation of rare diseases or atypical presentation of common diseases.&nbsp;</em></em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1170097-overview" target="_search">For more information, see: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on Medscape Updated: August 27, 2013 </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/26/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 55-year-old African-American male presents to the office with the complaint of <span class="Highlight">cough</span>. History reveals the cough is productive of yellow sputum and has been present for <span class="Highlight">four months</span>' duration. One month ago he presented to the emergency department with the same symptoms and was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and azithromycin, with minimal relief. Last year, he had a similar productive cough for four months' duration. He states he has been treated for pneumonia five times over the past two years. He has a 60-pack-year smoking history. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 134/92 mmHg, a heart rate of 82/min, a temperature of 37.3ºC (99.2ºF), and a respiratory rate of 20/min. Physical examination reveals mild dyspnea, diffuse rhonchi, expiratory wheezing bilaterally, and <span class="Highlight">retractions</span>. He does not have digital clubbing.

Chronic bronchitis is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), usually due to smoking. Symptoms are often minimal until the disease has advanced. Many patients have signs consistent with emphysema as well, but patients with isolate chronic bronchitis are classified as the classic “blue bloater.” They may present with cyanosis, mild dyspnea, a productive cough, obesity, peripheral edema, rhonchi, barrel chest, increased work of breathing/accessory muscle use, jugular venous distension, end-expiratory wheezing, and distant breath sounds. Patients may have signs of chronic hypercapnea (respiratory acidosis) and hypoxemia on blood gases. Radiographic imaging may show hyperinflation, decreased lung markings, and a thin mediastinum.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Although this patient has expiratory wheezing, his history of productive cough is more consistent with chronic bronchitis than asthma. It is also unlikely for asthma to first present at his current age.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Atypical pneumonia is usually treatable with antimicrobial agents such as azithromycin, which this patient has already completed.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Emphysema is often found in conjunction with chronic bronchitis; however, this patient clearly meets clinical criteria for chronic bronchitis due to his history of cough productive of sputum.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Although lung cancer is a possibility in this patient, he has no signs of systemic illness – fever, night sweats, or weight loss.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Chronic bronchitis is characterized by a productive cough for at least three months per year in two consecutive years.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/297664-overview" target="_search">"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 21-year-old female presents to the emergency department after a syncopal episode. History reveals that the patient has experienced several near-syncopal episodes over the past week associated with palpitations, blurred vision, and nausea. The patient denies past medical or surgical history and takes no medications. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, a heart rate of 60/min, a respiratory rate of 18/min, an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, and a temperature of 35°C (95°F). Physical examination reveals a thin, malnourished appearing female. The oropharynx is dry with angular cheilitis. Cardiovascular examination is without murmur, and a thorough neurologic examination is unremarkable except diffuse hyporeflexia. A bedside hemoglobin results at 13.1 g/dL. An ECG is obtained and shown in the exhibit. The most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms is</div><br>

In this case, the patient is very thin appearing, hypothermic, relatively hypotensive, and has angular cheilitis, all of which are indicative of malnutrition. In addition, the ECG shown is consistent with hypokalemia due to the U waves in leads V2-V5. U waves are additional upright waves that appear after T waves. In the workup of syncope or near syncope, an ECG is extremely important to screen for various arrhythmias and/or evidence of electrolyte abnormalities. &nbsp;Hypokalemia can cause QT prolongation, U waves, T wave inversion, or ST segment flattening. In addition, it can affect the automaticity of the pacemaker cells in the heart leading to bradycardia, AV block or even torsades de pointes.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Hypercalcemia is most commonly caused by malignancy and hyperparathyroidism, and is diagnosed at a serum level over 10.2 mg/dL. This is usually asymptomatic, but classically presents as bones (fractures), stones (kidney stones), groans (abdominal pain, constipation), and psychiatric overtones (weakness, confusion). Hypercalcemia causes a shortened QT interval on ECG.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hyperkalemia is defined as a serum K &gt; 5 mEq/L. Most commonly caused by renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, hypoaldosteronism, or ACE inhibitors, elevated potassium can cause nausea/vomiting, weakness, paresthesias, or be entirely asymptomatic. ECG findings include peaked T waves, wide QRS, PR prolongation, or ventricular fibrillation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Hypocalcemia in adults arises from malnutrition, pancreatitis, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Levels are usually below 8.5 mg/dL. It can present as muscle cramps/spasms, perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, and have exam findings such as a Chvostek or Trousseau sign. An ECG may show a prolonged QT interval, but should not show U waves unless a concurrent hypokalemia is occurring (which is common).<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome is a congenital abnormality involving abnormal conduction between the atria and ventricles in association with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It occurs during preexcitation, where an atrial impulse is not conducted down the atrioventricular pathway, but down an accessory pathway, most commonly down the bundle of Kent. ECG findings most commonly include a short PR interval (&lt;120 ms) and a wide QRS (&gt;120 ms) with a slurred onset of the R-wave (known as delta wave). This ECG does not show any of these findings.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in malnourished patients such as those suffering from an eating disorder. The most common ECG findings in hypokalemia include QT prolongation, U waves, T wave inversion, and/or ST segment flattening.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/242008-overview" target="_search">"Hypokalemia" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department complaining of substernal chest pain. History reveals a gradual onset of non-radiating, burning chest pain that has been constant for the past eight hours and began when he went to sleep. The patient denies diaphoresis, dizziness, or nausea. Past medical history reveals a knee injury two months prior for which his is taking over the counter pain medications. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 80/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness to palpation in the epigastrum. An ECG is obtained as shown in the exhibit. The most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute coronary syndrome</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">esophageal perforation</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">esophageal tear</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">gastritis</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">pulmonary embolus</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>This patient is most likely experiencing gastritis. A recent history of a musculoskeletal injury should lead you to suspect that the patient is taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen are three common over the counter drugs that work as nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COX) and create an increased acidic environment in the stomach. Over time, increased acidity in the stomach may create generalized inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), or focal ulcers. This patient has the onset of symptoms occur while going to sleep, which is common as the stomach contents may reflux into the esophagus in a supine position causing an increase in symptoms. The key to answering this question correctly and confidently is excluding more life threatening causes of chest pain by history, physical, and ECG findings.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This patient has a normal ECG. This rules out ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and regional ischemia. Importantly here, the patient complains of chest pain without associated symptoms (radiation, nausea, diaphoresis) and also objectively has epigastric tenderness. In addition, his age and lack of cardiac risk factors makes unstable angina and non-ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) extremely unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Esophageal perforation, also known as Boerhaave's syndrome, typically presents as severe chest pain in the setting of forceful retching. Tearing of the esophagus will often cause hematemesis, and spillage of gastric contents into the mediastinum will cause mediastinitis. These patients are often critically ill appearing, febrile, tachycardic, and require urgent surgical consultation. Given the well appearance of this patient and an unremarkable exam, esophageal perforation is unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> An esophageal tear is commonly associated with hematemesis. This syndrome is known as Mallory-Weiss syndrome/tear. Typically, patients will complain of nonbloody vomiting followed by an episode of blood-tinged vomitus. This patient has no such complaints and therefore an esophageal tear is unlikely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The patient describes a recent knee “injury” 8 weeks ago. Any patient who is post-operative with chest pain should have pulmonary embolism (PE) in their differential. However, a sprain or contusion of the knee is low risk for development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is not considered equivalent to a patient with a total knee replacement/knee surgery. One can use the PE rule out criteria in this case (PERC rule) to exclude PE from the differential. If the patient has none of the following, PE is less than 1.8% likely to be the cause of symptoms: 1) Age &gt; 50, 2) Heart rate &gt; 100/min, 3) Hypoxemia (02 sat &lt; 95%), 4) History of prior PE/DVT, 5) Recent surgery/trauma (past 6 weeks), 6) Hemoptysis, 7) Exogenous estrogen use, 8) Unilateral leg swelling. This patient has none of these criteria and therefore can have PE ruled out without use of D-dimer testing.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Suspect gastritis in a patient with a recent musculoskeletal injury complaining of abdominal or chest pain, as NSAIDs are a common cause of these symptoms.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/175909-overview" target="_search">"Acute Gastritis" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">If this rash were to become bullous, what toxin would most likely be responsible?</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Exfoliative toxin A</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Pyrogenic toxin</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Streptolysin O</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Streptolysin S</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>The most likely diagnosis is impetigo. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing impetigo, with Streptococcus pyogenes being the second most common. There are three types of impetigo, the first being the nonbullous form, the most common, making up nearly 70% of the cases. This type starts as papules and develops into vesicles, which break down forming a thick honey-crust appearance, which was originally seen in this patient. The second type is the bullous form. It results from strains of S. aureus that produce exfoliative toxin A. This exotoxin targets desmoglein and has pathophysiology similar to the pemphigus autoimmune disease. Fragile bullae develop filled with yellow fluid but are typically seen as an erythematous area surrounded by a rim once they burst. The least common form is ecthyma, which is the ulcerative type. Deep ulcers penetrate deep into the dermis and are covered with a yellow crust.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Pyrogenic exotoxins are produced by Streptococcus pyogenes and are considered a superantigen, which are substances that initiate an uncontrolled proliferation of T-cells without going through macrophages for activation.  This results in lymphocyte blastogenesis, possible endotoxin-induced shock, fever induction and suppression of antibody synthesis. This exotoxin has been associated with scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Streptolysin O is another virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes that is toxic to a wide variety of cell types, including the myocardium, and is highly immunogenic. Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer is a tool used to help differentiate whether a patient with acute renal failure or signs of rheumatic fever has been exposed to S. pyogenes as a cause for the problem.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Streptolysin S is a virulence factor from Streptococcus pyogenes that is capable of damaging leukocytes and cellular organelles, but it does not appear to be immunogenic.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 is a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus. This is the main toxin that is responsible for toxic shock syndrome. This toxin can activate the immune system by bypassing the normal sequence, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines cause capillary leakage and tissue damage, which leads to shock and multiorgan failure.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing impetigo. The most common type of this disease is the nonbullous form. However, the bullous form can be seen and is a result of the exfoliative toxin A.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/965254-overview" target="_search">"Impetigo" on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

Topical medications are equally effective to oral antibiotics for localized impetigo and provide a treatment option with fewer adverse effects compared to an oral antibiotic.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Gentle cleansing with diluted hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine, or diluted sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and removal of the honey-colored crusts of non-bullous impetigo may prevent the transmission of impetigo and prevent recurrences. However, the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide alone as the treatment for impetigo has not been proven.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Intravenous fluids would be indicated in patients with extensive areas of involvement with bullous impetigo. Severe dehydration may arise in these patients as a result of ruptured bullae, leaving denuded skin which allows excessive water loss.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Oral antibiotics would be indicated to treat impetigo that is widespread or associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever or diarrhea. Oral agents must provide coverage against both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antibiotics typically used include beta-lactamase resistant penicillins (i.e. amoxicillin/clavulanate and dicloxacillin) or a first generation cephalosporin (i.e. cephalexin).<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Certain antibiotics like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and vancomycin, should be reserved for treatment-resistant patients suspected of having impetigo due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Given this is the first incidence of impetigo in this patient and the disease is localized, suspicion for MRSA is low and a topical antibiotic is adequate treatment.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A topical antibiotic, such as mupirocin ointment, is the first-line treatment option for non-bullous impetigo.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>"Impetigo" in Clinical Dermatology: A color guide to diagnosis and therapy. 5th ed.<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/965254-overview" target="_search">"Impetigo" on Medscape<br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 23-year-old G1 female at 38 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department in labor. The fetal heart rate tracing is obtained as shown in the exhibit. The most likely cause of these findings is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">decreased oxygen delivery to the fetus</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">fetal head compression</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">maternal systemic lupus erythematosus</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">physiologic response to fetal movement</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">umbilical cord spasm</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>The tracing demonstrates early decelerations. Early decelerations are U-shaped decreases in fetal heart rate that begin with the onset of a contraction, nadir with the peak of contraction, and return to baseline as the contraction subsides. This pattern may occur during active labor between 4-7 cm cervical dilation. As the fetus descends and the skull is compressed, a change in cerebral blood flow or dura stimulation activates the vagal nerve and causes a transient decrease in fetal heart rate. As the contraction subsides, the vagal stimulation is removed and the fetal heart rate returns to baseline.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Decreased oxygen delivery to the fetus results in late decelerations.  A late deceleration is a decrease in fetal heart rate that begins after the uterine contraction begins, decelerates to 30-40 beats per minute below baseline, and then slowly returns.  In contrast to variable decelerations, late decelerations are not associated with accelerations that may occur before or after the heart rate change.  The delay is likely due to the complex reflex changes.  As hypoxia develops, oxygen sensors in the brain increase sympathetic activity, which raises blood pressure.  Fetal baroreceptors respond to the increased pressure by decreasing fetal heart rate.  There are a number of causes of uteroplacental insufficiency that result in decreased oxygen delivery, but the most common is excessive uterine contraction, often due to oxytocin administration.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Maternal systemic lupus erythematosis can affect the placental vasculature, reducing oxygen delivery to the fetus, and cause late decelerations. SLE, along with other collagen vascular diseases, is cause for uteroplacental insufficiency.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> An acceleration is a physiological response to fetal movement and represents an active, well-oxygenated fetus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Umbilical cord spasm or compression results in variable decelerations. These are abrupt decreases in fetal heart with rapid return to baseline. They may be associated with accelerations in fetal heart rate before and after the decelerations. As the cord is compressed, the thinner umbilical vein is occluded first which leads to decreased cardiac return. There is a reflex tachycardia and acceleration on the fetal heart rate tracing. With further compression, the artery is occluded, systemic resistance and fetal blood pressure increases. A protective reflex bradycardia occurs and there is a deceleration on the heart rate tracing. As the compressive force is removed, the pattern is reversed.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Fetal head compression causes early decelerations.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Fetal heart rate tracings are likely to show up on the exam.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 25-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a two-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She had three similar episodes in the past six months, for which she did not seek medical attention. She has lost 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) in this time period. She has no significant past medical history and is sexually active with one monogamous partner. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 90/min, and a temperature of 38.4ºC (101.1ºF). Physical examination reveals her abdomen is soft and non-distended with tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Pelvic examination is normal. A pregnancy test is obtained and is negative. Perianal examination discloses two-fistula orifices anterolateral to the anus with expression of white material with palpation. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>

It is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which constitutes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Crohn disease has variable manifestations. Perianal disease occurs in approximately one-quarter of patients with the formations of fistulas at any point in the bowel. Fistulas are abnormal connections between the bowel and adjacent organs. Abscess may form, and the fistula may act as a natural drainage system. Symptoms from fistulas can range from occasional painless drainage to painful cycles of abscess formation. Other features of CD depend on the location of the disease. If the colon is affected then diarrhea and bleeding may occur. If the small bowel is involved then postprandial pain and obstructive type symptoms will be present. Colonoscopy will show transmural involvement, skip lesions, cobblestone appearance, fistules, creeping fat, and perianal disease. Diagnosis is often made with colonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum in order to determine the presence of ileocolonic CD. On endoscopy, many of the characteristic features of Crohn’s disease, as detailed above can be visualized. Biopsies often confirm the diagnosis and show focal ulcerations and acute and chronic inflammation. Granulomas are also noted on biopsy in up to 30% of patients with CD.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Carcinoid tumor is the most common neoplasm of the appendix, and these tumors clinically present with episodes of flushing and diarrhea once metastasized to the liver. Grossly, the lesions are typically submucosal and yellow in appearance from high lipid content. This is unlikely in this patient given the clinical presentation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Meckel’s diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. It is usually located within two feet of the ileocecal valve and is approximately two inches in length along the antimesenteric border. They typically contain gastric mucosa and are, therefore, a common cause of painless rectal bleed in children less than two years of age.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Patients with perforated appendicitis have an acute presentation with right lower quadrant abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Abdominal exam typically reveals peritoneal signs such as guarding and rebound tenderness. Lack of the above signs and symptoms make appendicitis low on the differential. In addition, evidence of perianal disease is not the typical presentation of Crohn's disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Ulcerative colitis (UC) causes mucosal inflammation, which is isolated to the colon. UC always starts at the rectum and can proceed to the sigmoid or descending colon or continue proximal to the splenic flexure. Perianal pain and evidence of fistulas are not the usual presentation of UC. Patients typically present with bowel urgency secondary to rectal inflammation. Abdominal pain is an unusual manifestation of UC and can suggest a complication such as toxic megacolon. Given this patient presentation, UC is an unlikely diagnosis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Crohn’s disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Classic findings include deep, transmural ulcers with skip lesions, which differentiate Crohn’s from ulcerative colitis.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/172940-overview" target="_search">"Crohn Disease" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

PML is a rapidly progressive and usually fatal demyelination of the CNS due to destruction of the oligodendrocytes caused by the JC virus. The JC virus is extremely common, and serologies are positive in 70-90% of the population. PML is seen most often in AIDS patients; however, it can also be seen in those taking immunosuppressive therapies as well, allowing the virus to go unchecked. Natalizumab is an immunosuppressant indicated for relapsing multiple sclerosis to help prevent accumulation of disability and reduce the frequency of exacerbations. It is a monoclonal antibody that acts as an inhibitor of alpha-4 integrin. This medication has been linked to reactivation of the JC virus. It is extremely rare for PML to develop in those who have been taking the medication for less than one year, but the incidence increases the longer a patient is on the medication. Because of the risk for PML, patients are required to enter into a rigorous screening and follow-up protocol. The MRI findings in the question stem are classically associated with PML.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D:</strong> All of these medications are used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis to help prevent relapse and progression, however PML is only associated with natalizumab.  Glatiramer and beta-interferon are the best initial choice for prevention of relapse.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Its use has been linked to a progressive demyelination of the central nervous system called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

The drug of choice for all adult patients with platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 is prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day. Second line drugs used in treatment of ITP include IVIG, rituximab and thrombopoietic agents such as Promacta (eltrombopag) and Nplate (romiplostim). In refractory cases, splenectomy can be recommended. Adults with severe thrombocytopenia (ie, a platelet count below 30,000/microL) at the time of diagnosis are almost always treated even if they are asymptomatic or have only minor bleeding symptoms, because the course of the disease and the risk for future bleeding cannot be known. This contrasts with the management of children who are often not treated even with severe thrombocytopenia and petechiae, because spontaneous remissions often occur in children. Avoid unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (ie, a platelet count greater than 30,000 to 50,000/microL)<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is a treatment used in diseases involving bone marrow such as aplastic anemia, certain lymphomas, and leukemia and is not a correct answer.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> If the platelet count is &gt;30,000/mm3 and they are asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary; however, this patient’s platelet count is &lt; 30,000/mm3 and she is having mucosal bleeding, therefore not giving her any treatment is not a correct answer.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; D:</strong> Factor VIII concentrate is a treatment of Von Willebrand’s disease and will not be useful in this patient. FFP and cryoprecipitate are treatments of DIC and have no role in treatment of ITP.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>In ITP if&nbsp;patient&nbsp;is asymptomatic, and the platelet count is &gt;30,000/mm3, treatment can be held off. The mainstay of the treatment in symptomatic patients is glucocorticoids (prednisone) and IVIG. The goal of the treatment is to keep platelets &gt;50,000/mm3.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>You are often asked to differentiate between ITP and TTP on COMLEX level 2 CE.

PBC is an autoimmune disorder that results in T-lymphocyte mediated destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts, eventually causing cholestasis. Patients are typically middle-aged women that present with pruritus, skin hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and fatigue with a cholestatic pattern of liver function tests. The clinical presentation of PBC is different from most other liver diseases, making it very likely to be the diagnosis if a middle-aged woman presents with cholestatic liver function tests, pruritis, skin changes, and hepatomegaly. The antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is a highly sensitive test and is positive in nearly 95% of patients with the disease with only a 2% false positive rate. If the AMA is positive, a liver biopsy is usually done to stage the disease and rule out other liver disorders. Treatment involves ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to slow the progression of the disease and eventual liver transplantation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> α-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver, lungs, or skin. Disease in the liver is due to the accumulation of the variant protein within hepatocytes. Typically, this would present with abnormal aminotransferase concentrations and not a cholestatic picture, as this patient has.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The hepatitis B surface antibody can be seen in patients with either prior vaccination against hepatitis B or after having cleared an acute hepatitis B infection. This patient does not have risk factors for hepatitis B, and her clinical presentation is not typical.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> This patient has no risk factors for hepatitis C such as injection drug use or blood transfusion. Acute cases of hepatitis would present with jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and elevated or markedly elevated AST/ALT.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Despite her fatigue, she lacks other symptoms of hypothyroidism: skin changes, hair changes, decreased bowel movements. Furthermore, her examination and provided laboratory profile suggests a hepatic etiology.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Primary biliary cirrhosis is associated with antimitochondrial antibody. Patients are typically middle-aged women that present with jaundice, pruritus, and fatigue.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/171117-overview" target="_search">"Primary Biliary Cirrhosis" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 50-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a three-day history of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain is constant and is not relieved with defecation. History reveals he has associated nausea and anorexia. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and diverticulosis. His only medication is hydrochlorothiazide. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 80/min, and a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination reveals his stool is heme positive. Laboratory analysis reveals his WBC is 17,000 cells/cm<sup>3</sup>. He is started on intravenous antibiotics. Three days later the patient remains febrile with no clinical improvement. Abdominal examination is significant for tenderness in the left lower quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. The next best step in management is</div><br>

Diverticulitis is the result of obstruction at the neck of a diverticulum, usually by fecal matter and this complication usually occurs in 15-25% of patients with diverticulosis. The most sensitive imaging modality for diverticulosis is abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. A contrast CT scan is also the most sensitive imaging modality to evaluate for any of the possible complications of diverticulitis, including perforation, abscess, obstruction, and fistula. Given that this patient has not had clinical improvement with IV antibiotics, a CT scan is indicated at this time to rule out a possible abscess. While small abscesses may be managed successfully with bowel rest, treatment of most abscesses usually consists of CT-guided percutaneous drainage.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Abdominal x-ray would be useful in diagnosing perforations. While perforations are a known complication of diverticulitis, this patient does not have any peritoneal signs, such as guarding or rebound tenderness to suggest an acute perforation.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; D:</strong> Barium enema and colonoscopy are the two tests that risk perforation in acute episodes of diverticulitis since the colon is very friable due to infection and inflamed diverticula. Neither test should be performed at this time.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A urinalysis is not indicated at this time as the most likely source of infection is in the abdomen.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>In acute episodes of diverticulitis, colonoscopy is contraindicated, and if there is no therapeutic response to antibiotics, a CT scan with contrast should be ordered.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-colonic-diverticular-disease" target="_search">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of colonic diverticular disease." on UpToDate.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/23/2016</em></span>

This is characteristic of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril are common causes of hyperkalemia. These drugs block the formation of angiotensin thus decreasing the secretion of aldosterone. This can lead to elevated potassium. ACE inhibitors are used in diabetic patients to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors protect the kidneys in hypertensive diabetic patients who are at double risk of kidney injury.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acetazolamide causes hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.  It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used to treat glaucoma, epileptic seizures, pseudotumor cerebri, and altitude sickness.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Digoxin can also cause heart block and other arrhythmias. It is primarily used to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. However, beta-blockers or calcium channel-blockers are the first-line treatment. The side effects of digoxin are more common in patients with hypokalemia as digoxin competes with potassium ions for the same binding site on the sodium-potassium ATPase pump.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Furosemide causes hypokalemia (potassium wasting) and metabolic alkalosis. It is a loop diuretic used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and edema.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Metoprolol is a beta-1 receptor blocker that is also known to cause hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors are more common causes of hyperkalemia and are also more frequently utilized in diabetic patients due to the renal-protective properties than beta-blockers.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hyperkalemia is associated with peaked T-waves on ECG and ACE inhibitors.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Pharmacology is not tested as heavily on step II compared with step I but you still need to know the most common side effects of common medications.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/766479-overview" target="_search">"Hyperkalemia in Emergency Medicine" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">chronic myelogenous leukemia</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">hairy cell leukemia</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Hodgkin lymphoma</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">multiple myeloma</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>The most likely diagnosis is hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia is a malignant disorder of well-differentiated B lymphocytes. It is a rare type of adult leukemia that usually affects the elderly male population. HCL often presents with splenomegaly, weakness, fatigue, petechiae, abdominal pain, early satiety and weight loss. Symptoms are similar to those seen in patients with CLL except that HCL patients rarely have lymphadenopathy. HCL is diagnosed based on history, physical exam and labs but the diagnosis is confirmed through the identification of hairy cells in the blood, blood marrow or spleen. TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) stain and flow cytometry are helpful in distinguishing the pathognomonic hairy cells (see below). Peripheral smear shows hairy cells, also described as mononuclear cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and cytoplasmic projections. Ten percent of patients with HCL will never require treatment as they have a benign disease course. However, treatment should begin when patients become symptomatic or cytopenic. Nucleoside analogs are the initial treatment of choice.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> CLL is a malignant clonal proliferation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes. This is the most common type of leukemia and is commonly a diagnosis of elderly males. Most cases of CLL involve well-differentiated B lymphocytes although a very rare T cell type of CLL has been described. First-degree relatives of patients with CLL are three times more likely to develop the disorder. CLL is often asymptomatic but many patients may present with infection, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. CBC usually shows an abundance of small, normal appearing lymphocytes and ruptured smudge cells on peripheral smear. Bone marrow biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis or staging but may provide prognostic information and help assess response to therapy. Treatment is usually withheld until the patient becomes symptomatic. When symptomatic, CLL is treated with chemotherapy and radiation. The Rai staging system is commonly used for CLL, which correlates with survival.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> CML involves a clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells leading to leukocytosis with excess granulocytes and basophils. It may present with anemia, splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. CBC analysis will show a very high WBC, often greater than 100,000.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Hodgkin disease is a predominately B-cell malignancy. It may have an association with EBV. It usually presents in the third decade or sixth decade. Nodular sclerosing type is the most common type in patients in their thirties while lymphocyte depleted type is more common in patients in their sixties. HD usually presents with cervical adenopathy but it may also present with a mediastinal mass. Early in its presentation, it is present above the diaphragm with infradiaphragmatic involvement suggesting more disseminated disease. Other presenting signs include systemic symptoms, pruritus and hepatosplenomegaly. Pel-Ebstein fevers and alcohol induced nodal pain are rare but specific signs of Hodgkin’s disease. Diagnosis of HD is best made with excisional lymph node biopsy because fine-needle biopsy is usually non-diagnostic. Histology is considered positive when Reed-Sternberg cells are observed, which are abnormal giant cells with bilobar nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli. The most common subtype of HD is nodular sclerosing type.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Multiple myeloma is due to a clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells with excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments. It is mainly a disease of the elderly population and has a peak incidence in the seventh decade. It usually presents with signs of anemia, bone pain, lytic bone lesions, and signs of hypercalcemia such as polyuria, constipation and confusion. The classic triad for MM is greater than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, M protein in the urine and evidence of lytic bone lesions. Because multiple myeloma is a osteoclastic process, a bone scan that detects osteoblastic activity, may be negative. MM treatment consists of chemotherapy, often with melphalan and prednisone.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hairy cell leukemia is a malignant disorder of well-differentiated B lymphocytes that stain positive with the TRAP stain.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em><em>Some questions on COMLEX exams will have only one logical answer choice.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 70-year-old male presents to the emergency department accompanied by his wife who reports that he has been sleeping all day and not answering questions appropriately. History reveals the patient has early-onset dementia and hypertension for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive elderly man with strong carotid pulses and spontaneous respirations. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg, a heart rate of 42/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. An ECG is obtained as shown in the exhibit. The most appropriate initial treatment is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">atropine</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">dopamine</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">epinephrine</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">transcutaneous pacing</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">transvenous pacing</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>This patient is presenting with unstable bradycardia (hypotension, hypoxemia) and should be treated with IV atropine as first line therapy per the 2010 AHA ACLS guidelines. A possible etiology in this scenario may be excessive/repeated dosing of metoprolol which commonly occurs in patients with dementia. Atropine works to increase heart rate through vagolytic effects, causing increase in cardiac output. Sinus bradycardia is a rhythm in which fewer than the normal number of impulses arise from the sinoatrial (SA) node, usually described at a rate less than 50/min (60/min in some texts). This can occur in normal individuals, be associated with sinus node dysfunction, or be the result of medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. In this ECG, every sinus P-wave has a subsequent ventricular depolarization and QRS complex. The PR interval is normal, and the rate is 42/min.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Dopamine is a potent vasopressor used as a chronotropic and inotropic medication in ACLS. Dopamine is not recommended as first line treatment of symptomatic bradycardia (or any ACLS condition for that matter). Dopamine stimulates dopamine, β, and α adrenergic receptors that effectively increases cardiac output and peripheral resistance leading to increased blood pressure and perfusion to tissues. It is used more commonly in the treatment of septic or cardiogenic shock.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Epinephrine is a chronotropic medication that mainly stimulates β-1 adrenergic receptors, although has β-2 activity and slight α-1 activity as well. It is used as first line medication in pulseless ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) algorithms. In symptomatic bradycardia, it is used as an infusion after atropine has been used and while transcutaneous pacing is being arranged.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Transcutaneous pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradycardia when atropine has failed improve the clinical situation. Pacing pads are placed on the patient’s chest and back and electricity is delivered through the chest wall to simulate myocardial contraction. Transcutaneous pacing is an effective way of temporarily maintaining an adequate heart rate and blood pressure but should only be used as a bridge toward more definitive care.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Transvenous pacing is indicated when transcutaneous pacing and medications fail to produce an appropriate, perfusing cardiac output. Transvenous pacing involves placing an electrode into the heart through the superior vena cava and stimulating myocardial contraction from within the heart much like a typical pacemaker.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Symptomatic bradycardia can present as altered mental status, chest pain, hypotension, or hypoxemia. First line treatment is atropine.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Be familiar with ACLS guidelines, especially the initial treatment for common cardiac arrhythmias. They are often tested to the first level of treatment but rarely further down the algorithm.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/760220-overview" target="_search">"Sinus bradycardia" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">activated charcoal</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">ipecac syrup</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">N-acetylcysteine</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">observation</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">whole bowel irrigation</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>Acetaminophen overdose is a common toxicologic emergency. It is the most common cause of acute hepatic failure in the United States. The clinical course typically follows four phases of progression. In phase 1 patients are usually asymptomatic or complain of anorexia, nausea and vomiting. There is a slight elevation in transaminases. This phase is from 0-24 hours after ingestion. Phase 2 arises 18-72 hours after ingestion and involves right upper quadrant pain, tachycardia and hypotension. Phase 3 is the most lethal stage and occurs at hours 72-96. It involves hepatic necrosis, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy and renal failure. Phase 4 occurs after 4 days assuming patients recovered from phase 3. It involves a resolution of organ failure and symptoms. N-acetylcysteine is the drug of choice in treatment of acetaminophen toxicity. It is pregnancy class B and works by acting as a sulfhydryl donor to restore glutathione in the liver. Ideally, N-acetylcysteine should be initiated prior to the elevation in alanine aminotransferase but even with late presentations it has been found to be protective of the liver.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Activated charcoal is used in certain toxic overdoses when the ingestion has occurred within the past 30 minutes to one hour.  It would be of no benefit in an overdose occurring 24 hours prior.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Ipecac syrup was once used a pro-emetic substance to induce evacuation of the stomach after ingestion of toxic substances. It is no longer used in this manner as it carries a risk of aspiration.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Observation would not be an appropriate treatment in a symptomatic patient with admitted acetaminophen ingestion. The only time it may be acceptable is if serum acetaminophen levels were undetectable.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Whole bowel irrigation involves administration of large amounts of osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol in order to flush the gastrointestinal tract and prevent absorption of toxic substances.  It is not indicated 24 hours after an ingestion and is not commonly used in acetaminophen overdose.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>N-acetylcysteine is the drug of choice for treatment of acetaminophen toxicity.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.emedicine.medscape.com/article/820200-overview" target="_search">"Acetaminophen Toxicity" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 74-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient is able to <span class="Highlight">converse</span> but is visibly short of breath and complains of having difficulty breathing. Vital signs reveal tachycardia and tachypnea. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds in the left middle and lower lung fields. Plain radiographs are obtained and reveal a left pleural effusion. Thoracentesis drains <span class="Highlight">odorless</span> fluid. Fluid analysis reveals a&nbsp;ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride that is less than 0.75. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>

A chylothorax is associated with trauma, recent thoracic surgery, and malignancy. Thoracentesis with triglycerides &gt; 110 mg/dL is almost always pathognomonic of lymphatic fluid leak into the pleural space from the thoracic duct.&nbsp;A ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride of less than 1 is also diagnostic.&nbsp;Recall, the thoracic duct is the left-sided structure that filters the majority of the lymphatic fluid back into venous circulation. A pleural effusion can be serous fluid (hydrothorax), blood (hemothorax), chyle (chylothorax), or pus (pyothorax/empyema).<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Congestive heart failure usually causes straw-colored fluid with mononuclear cell predominance.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Empyema pleural fluid typically has a leukocytosis, low pH (&lt;7.20), low glucose (&lt;60 mg/dL), high LDH (lactic dehydrogenase), elevated protein and is malodorous.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Pneumonia is contained within the lung unless it causes the accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity (empyema).<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Pseudochylothorax, or cholesterol pleurisy, must be distinguished from chylothorax. Pseudochylothorax results from an accumulation of cholesterol crystals in a chronic existing effusion. The most common cause of pseudochylothorax is chronic rheumatoid pleurisy, followed by tuberculosis and poorly treated empyema.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Chylothorax pleural fluid is milky white with high triglycerides.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Pleural fluid analysis aids in differentiation between diseases.

The patients risk factors include a medical history of malignancy and tobacco history. The five major mechanisms of hypoxia include; decrease fractionally inspiration oxygen, hypoventilation, diffusion impairment, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and shunt. A pulmonary embolism is an example of a ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Another example of V/Q mismatch is pneumonia. The mechanism of hypoxia can be determined by evaluating the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient, the PCO2 level, the effect of administered oxygen, and the diffusion limited carbon monoxide capacity (DLCO). V/Q mismatch is characterized by a high or normal PCO2, an increased A-a gradient, a positive effect of administered oxygen, and a normal DLCO. The A-a gradient represents the difference in PAO2 (alveolar) and PaO2 (arterial). A normal A-a gradient is around 8-12 mmHg and increases with age. It is increased in cases of pulmonary embolism because the embolism is blocking the blood flow to the lungs for gas exchange to occur resulting in higher O2 levels in the alveoli as opposed to the artery.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; E:</strong> The expected change in A-a gradient would be an increase in V/Q mismatch. An increase in A-a gradient can also be seen in cases of diffusion impairment and shunting.<br><br><br><strong>Answers B &amp; D:</strong> DLCO is normal in cases of V/Q mismatch. A decreased DLCO is seen in cases of diffusion impairment across the alveoli (i.e. pulmonary fibrosis), or in cases of decreased blood transit time through the alveoli (i.e. anemia).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A pulmonary embolism presents with an increase in A-a gradient.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Remember the five mechanisms of hypoxia include; decrease fractionally inspiration oxygen, hypoventilation, diffusion impairment, ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and shunt. Each is characterized by different findings. Hypoventilation is characterized by the hallmark of increased PCO2 as seen on arterial blood gas. The hallmark of diffusion impairment is a decreased DLCO, and the hallmark of shunt is a negligible effect of oxygen administration on hypoxia.</em><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/28/2016</em></span>

She exhibits paranoia, mood lability, irritability, fear of abandonment, self harm, and splitting (where she sees you as "all good", but another doctor as "all bad"). Borderline personality disorder is more common in women. Extensive psychotherapy with dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is the treatment of choice for borderline personality disorder. In this form of therapy, the therapist must be supportive and directive, and the patient is given specific assignments and homework to help their problem solving skills and improve their interpersonal skills and overall coping. DBT focuses on teaching the patient mindfulness, distress tolerance without impulsivity, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. The goal and focus of this therapy is to reduce the impulses to self-mutilate. DBT is the only treatment for borderline personality disorder with data to support its efficacy. It is used in both outpatient and inpatient settings.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Lithium is a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

Since both parents have sickle cell disease, the child must also have sickle cell disease. Children with sickle cell disease are susceptible to infection with encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. In addition to the routine childhood vaccinations, these children should also receive the pneumococcal vaccine at age 2 and a booster shot at age 5, as well as a one time meningococcal vaccine given after age 2.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">An 80-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pressure that began twelve hours ago while at rest. This pressure is associated with right arm discomfort. History reveals no previous cardiac problems and he currently takes no medications. Physical examination reveals a well appearing elderly male in no distress. Vitals reveal a blood pressure of 167/90 mmHg, a heart rate of 75/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and a room air oxygen saturation of 94%. A troponin level ten minutes later is elevated. While you are explaining your current plan to the patient, he becomes diaphoretic and unresponsive. His telemetry strip is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following best describes his telemetry strip?</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">multifocal atrial tachycardia</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">sinus bradycardia</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">third degree AV block</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">type I mobitz 2nd degree AV block</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">type II mobitz 2nd degree AV block</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>Third degree AV block (complete heart block) is defined as complete dissociation between the atrium and ventricular conduction systems. This is noted on the surface ECG by P-wave and QRS complexes having no relation to one another. In this question, the P-waves are regularly appearing at a rate of 75/min and the ventricular rate is 43/min. Note that occasionally there are p-waves “hidden” in T-waves and also occurring after the QRS complex. This pattern of atrioventricular dissociation is common during myocardial ischemia (as this patient is currently experiencing) or infarction due to underperfusion of the AV conduction system.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is a tachydysrhythmia that is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm, rate &gt;100/min, and 3 different consecutive atrial morphologies. In this question, the rate is regular, slow, and the atrial waves are similar.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Sinus bradycardia is defined as a rate less than 50/min with atrioventricular association. For every sinus P-wave, there is a subsequent ventricular depolarization and QRS complex. In this question, there is a dissociation between P-waves and QRS complexes.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Type I mobitz 2nd degree AV block is also known as Wenckebach block. This arrhythmia is defined as regularly irregular, with a progressive lengthening of the PR interval until a ventricular beat is not conducted. Following the non-conducted beat, the following PR interval is noted to be shortened. In the question there is no association between the P-wave and the QRS complex therefore there is no lengthening of the PR interval.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Type II mobitz 2nd degree AV block is characterized on a surface ECG by intermittently non-conducted P-waves not preceded by PR prolongation and not followed by PR shortening. In this question, there is no association between P-waves and QRS complexes, therefore all P-waves are non-conducted by definition.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Third degree heart block is a condition in which there is complete dissociation between P-waves and QRS complexes due to complete loss of electrical conduction between the atria and the ventricles.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Have a system for interpreting ECGs. Start with rate (determine regular, tachycardia or bradycardia), and rhythm (determine regularity or irregularity). Next determine whether P-waves are “talking” to the QRS complexes: for every P-wave, there should be a QRS following close behind. Next determine axis, followed by looking at PR and QT intervals. Finally, assess the ECG for repolarization - ie, ST segment elevation/depression or T-wave inversion. If you complete this systematically on every ECG, you will not overlook any critical part of the tracing.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/162007-overview" target="_search">"Third degree heart block"</a><br>Wolfson, Allan B et al. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harwood-Nuss’ Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine.</span> 5th Ed.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the last few hours' duration. History reveals he was eating pizza and drinking beers with a few friends when the pain began. The pain radiates from his epigastrium directly to his back and is <span class="Highlight">constant</span>. He has never had similar abdominal pain in the past. The patient has no known past medical history and takes no medications except for an over-the-counter vitamin supplement. He smokes socially and drinks approximately 3 beers once a week with his friends. His family history is significant for a father that died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 45, and a grandfather with coronary artery disease. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 105/65 mmHg, a heart rate of 115/min, a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), and a respiratory rate of 20/min. &nbsp;Physical examination reveals there are several xanthomas under his eyes. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. There is mid-epigastric tenderness to palpation and mild abdominal distension. &nbsp;His laboratory values are shown below:<br> <br>

                <br> The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms are</div><br>

While pancreatitis most commonly occurs secondary to gallstones and alcohol, this patient is unlikely to have either of these causes. Other causes of pancreatitis include drugs, hypercalcemia, infectious causes, ischemia, vasculitis, malignancy, and dyslipidemia. The most likely etiology of his pancreatitis is hypertriglyceridemia given his family history and the notable xanthomas on physical exam, suggesting high serum triglyceride levels. When confirmed, it is important to treat the patient's hypertriglyceridemia to prevent future episodes of pancreatitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis typically present with sudden onset of epigastric pain, which can radiate to their back. Oftentimes, abdominal pain is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and tachycardia. On physical examination, patients usually will have abdominal tenderness to palpation, particularly in the epigastric region. Abdomen is often times distended and hypoactive bowel sounds are present. Diagnosis is made with laboratory studies that will typically show an amylase and lipase level that are at least three times the upper limit of normal. However, degree of elevation of pancreatic enzymes does not correlate with how severe the disease is. Moreover, such as is the case with this patient, in approximately one-third of patients, the enzyme levels will not be three times above the upper limit of normal. Also, high levels of amylase can be caused by a variety of other disorders including salivary glands, fallopian tubes, perforated ulcers, intestinal ischemia, or chronic renal insufficiency. Computed tomography (CT) can often aid in making the diagnosis and is the most specific test. CT scan will often show enlargement of the pancreas, peripancreatic inflammation, and fluid collections. Management consists of bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and pain control.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Alcohol is one of the most common causes of pancreatitis, but it is typically the result of chronic alcoholism. While this patient admits to drinking, he only endorses drinking socially, and approximately three beers per week,  making alcohol abuse an unlikely cause of his acute pancreatitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Recent studies have documented a link between cigarette smoking and acute pancreatitis, but it occurs as a result of long-term, consistent usage, not the social smoking described by this patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> In factitious disorder, the patient fakes or causes a condition for primary gain of being taken care of in the sick role. This patient, however, has no risk factors for factious disorder, such as recurrent hospitalizations. Moreover, his laboratory studies and xanthomas suggest acute pancreatitis secondary to high triglyceride levels.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Gallstones are an extremely common cause of pancreatitis. Although this patient should certainly receive a right upper quadrant ultrasound to search for any stones, his chronic hypertriglyceridemia is a more likely cause. Gallstones usually present with right upper quadrant pain preceding the episode of pancreatitis, and the risk factors for gallstones are usually obesity, female sex, fertility, and age over 40.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hypertriglyceridemia is a known cause of pancreatitis. &nbsp;It should be suspected in patients with a family history and by physical exam findings, such as xanthomas.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/181364-overview" target="_search">"Acute Pancreatitis" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/22/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 2-year-old male infant is brought to the emergency department by his mother because she feels that the child appears dusky. History reveals that he may have ingested his grandfather's sublingual nitroglycerin. &nbsp;Physical examination reveals cyanosis and dyspnea with clear lungs on auscultation. &nbsp;When obtaining an arterial blood sample, the technician notes that the blood appears brown. The results of the sample yield a normal pO2. The most effective therapy for this patient is</div><br>

It is used in the advanced cardiac life support algorithm for cardiac arrest, severe asthma, and anaphylaxis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Furosemide is a loop diuretic.  It is not used in the management of methemoglobin.  It is indicated for the management of edema, resistant hypertension, acute pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis, increased intracranial pressure, and for hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia in advanced cardiac life support.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a second-line option for patients with severe methemoglobinemia whose condition does not respond to methylene blue or who cannot be treated with methylene blue, such as those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Methemoglobinemia may present with dyspnea and cyanosis with a normal pO2, headache, confusion, seizures, and/or metabolic acidosis. &nbsp;First line therapy is with methylene blue.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204178-overview" target="_search"><br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 68-year-old female presents to the emergency department with the complaint of abdominal pain. History reveals that she developed an acute onset of severe, constant, cramping, <span class="Highlight">periumbilical</span> pain one-hour prior to arrival. Past medical history is significant for an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and early-onset dementia. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 160/95mmHg, a heart rate of 75/min, a respiratory rate of 30/min, and a temperature of 37ºC (98.6ºF). Physical examination reveals an elderly woman who appears extremely uncomfortable lying in bed. She has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm and clear lungs by auscultation. Abdominal examination reveals a soft, minimally tender abdomen without rebound, guarding, detectable mass, or surgical scars. Femoral pulses are normal bilaterally with brisk distal perfusion. The most likely etiology of this patient’s current condition is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">acute myocardial infarction</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">arterial embolism</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">perforated viscus</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">small bowel obstruction</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>This elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation is most likely experiencing acute mesenteric ischemia from an arterial embolus. This patient is high risk to be non-compliant with her medications, one of which is probably warfarin, thus making her high risk for developing a thrombus. Atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular rhythm) predisposes to left atrial or ventricular thrombi that may become dislodged and travel through the arterial system such as the carotid arteries causing acute ischemic stroke. If the embolus travels through the descending aorta, it may wind up obstructing the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery (most commonly), inferior mesenteric artery, or a distal extremity artery. Acute blockage of an artery supplying the mesentery and intestines can cause bowel necrosis, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death if not diagnosed in a timely fashion. It is critical to notice that this patient has pain out of proportion to her physical examination - she appears uncomfortable yet has a relatively benign abdominal examination. Diagnose mesenteric ischemia with an abdominal CT angiography study and arrange for surgical consultation immediately if suspicion is high enough. Treatment is surgical thrombectomy or catheter directed clot lysis via interventional radiology.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Abdominal pain in an elderly woman is notorious for an atypical presentation of chest pain and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There should be a high suspicion of ACS in women, diabetics, and the elderly who present with abdominal pain. An ECG should be obtained early in the workup to rule an ST elevation myocardial infarction out, especially with a patient presenting in atrial fibrillation. However, in this scenario, close attention to the history and physical exam findings make mesenteric ischemia more likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> A perforated viscus (intestine) can occur in any patient population and should be high on the differential in those presenting with an acute abdomen. These patients typically have pain in proportion to their exam, and signs of peritonitis (abdominal rigidity, guarding, and rebound tenderness) due to air and intestinal contents spilling into the peritoneal cavity. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) or those on chronic steroids are at higher risk of intestinal perforation. This patient does not have any predisposing condition to make this answer choice most likely. In addition, this patient clearly has pain out of proportion to her physical exam making a perforation of the intestine less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life threatening emergency. It typically presents as an acute onset of abdominal pain that radiates to the back due to blood spilling into the retroperitoneum. A pulse deficit in the lower extremities or a pulsatile mass may be found on physical exam, which are both notably absent in this scenario. AAA should be on the differential in this patient scenario, however is less likely than mesenteric ischemia based on history of atrial fibrillation and pain out of proportion to exam.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common occurrence in elderly patients and may present in many different ways. Typically, patients complain of acute or subacute abdominal pain, followed by nausea, vomiting, and inability to defecate or pass flatulence. Physical exam typically reveals a distended, tympanitic abdomen with high-pitched bowel sounds. The most common causes of SBO is prior abdominal surgery (adhesions), hernias, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignancy. This patient neither has the history or physical exam findings to make SBO likely (absence of abdominal scars, non-distended abdomen, etc).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Suspect acute mesenteric ischemia from an arterial embolism in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation who present with abdominal pain that is out of proportion to their physical exam.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Pain out of proportion to exam should make you think of 3 things: 1) mesenteric ischemia, 2) necrotizing fasciitis, and 3) compartment syndrome. If you remember these three conditions and apply them correctly, you will not miss these important, high-yield topics.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/189146-overview " target="_search">"Acute Mesenteric Ischemia" on Medscape.  </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 16-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of diarrhea for six months' duration. History reveals she has multiple episodes of bulky, high-volume, non-bloody stools daily. Diarrhea typically occurs after meals, and is associated with flatulence, bloating, and mild, diffuse crampy abdominal pain, which is relieved by defecation. Otherwise, she is generally healthy and takes no medications. Physical examination reveals the abdomen is not distended and there is no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are normoactive. A breath hydrogen test is completed and is positive at <span class="Highlight">25</span> ppm. The best initial management of this patient is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">increasing dietary fiber</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">increasing dietary protein</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">reduction of dietary complex carbohydrates</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">reduction of dietary glucose</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">reduction of dietary lactose</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>This patient most likely has lactose intolerance, which has a fairly high prevalence in the United States. Lactose intolerance is the result of low intestinal lactase levels, which are either secondary to mucosal injury or decreased genetic expression of the lactase enzyme, which hydrolyzes lactose at the intestinal brush border. In patients with lactase deficiency, up to 70% of the lactose passes unabsorbed through the small intestine into the colon. In the colon, lactose is converted into short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen gas by the bacterial flora. The excess hydrogen gas produced by the colonic flora is the basis for the hydrogen breath test that is used to diagnose lactose intolerance. Clinically, patients present with crampy abdominal pain that is usually periumbilical or in the lower quadrants. They will also usually have bloating, flatulence, vomiting, and bulky, frothy and watery stools (the excess lactose in the colon results in an osmotic diarrhea). Diagnosis is made with, as mentioned above, the lactose breath hydrogen test. During the test, the patient is given oral lactose while fasting, a sample breath hydrogen is taken at baseline and at 30 minute intervals for a total of 3 hours. A hydrogen level of 10 ppm (parts per million) is normal, 10-20 ppm is usually indeterminate, &gt; 20 ppm is diagnostic of lactose intolerance. Treatment for these patients primarily consists of decreasing lactose in their diet and maintaining appropriate levels of calcium and vitamin D. Lactase enzyme supplements are also available, but there is not currently enough data to support their efficacy.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Increasing dietary fiber has been shown to be useful for patients with diverticulosis and constipation, but plays no role in management of patients with lactose intolerance<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Increasing dietary protein has no role in the treatment of lactose intolerance, as these patients' primary problem is the inability to digest dietary lactose.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; D:</strong> Reduction of dietary glucose and complex carbohydrates are unnecessary as patients with lactose intolerance are only unable to digest dietary lactose, due to deficiency in the enzyme lactase, but are able to digest other forms of dietary glucose and complex carbohydrates.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Lactose intolerance is the results of low intestinal levels of the enzyme lactase. Reduction of dietary lactose is the best treatment for reduction of symptoms.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/187249-overview" target="_search">Lactose Intolerance" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 15-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of mid-back pain. History reveals the pain has been steadily increasing over the last year since she had a growth spurt. Physical examination reveals a rib hump from T4-T9 on the <span class="Highlight">right</span> with forward flexion. Sidebending to the right has no change on the rib hump. What is the most likely diagnosis?</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">T4-T9 left functional scoliosis</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">T4-T9 left structural scoliosis</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">T4-T9 right functional scoliosis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">T4-T9 right moderate scoliosis</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">T4-T9 right structural scoliosis</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>Scoliotic curves are named for the spinal convexity. Since scoliosis is a group curve, it is more likely to exhibit Type 1 mechanics with sidebending and rotation occurring in opposite directions. A scoliotic curve that is convex right is sidebent left, which would cause rotation to the right. The right rotation pushes the rib heads posteriorly, resulting in the rib hump. The rib hump is always on the side of convexity. Scoliotic curves are also classified as levoscoliosis (convex left) or dextroscoliosis (convex right). A functional scoliosis is a scoliotic curve that is secondary to another cause, such as a short leg. These curves are flexible and will go away with sidebending toward the convexity. In a structural scoliosis, the rib hump will remain as in the above scenario because the curve is rigid.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This patient exhibits a right scoliosis because the rib hump is on the right. Also, it is a structural curve since it does not resolve with sidebending toward the convexity.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> T4-T9 left structural scoliosis would be correct if the rib hump were on the left, not the right. Scoliotic curves are named for the side of convexity, which is opposite of the side to which the curve sidebends.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> T4-T9 right functional scoliosis would be the correct answer choice if the curve resolved with sidebending right, indicating a functional curve. However, the curve did not change with sidebending right, therefore, it is a structural scoliosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Moderate scoliosis is defined based on the Cobb angle of the curve. A Cobb angle between 20-45 degrees is considered to be moderate scoliosis. A radiograph is necessary to determine the Cobb angle and, therefore, to determine the severity of the curve.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Scoliosis is named for the side of the convexity.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Scoliosis is a common topic that may show up as an OMM question, a respiratory or cardiac question, or even a surgery question.</em><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/26/2016</em></span>

Aldosterone is secreted from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in response to decreased circulating plasma volume, hyperkalemia or hyponatremia. Pathologic hyperaldosteronism is usually secondary to adrenocortical hyperplasia but can also result from a unilateral adrenal adenoma, also referred to as Conn’s syndrome. Patients often present with hypertension, increased urination, muscle weakness, parasthesias or headache. Physical exam may reveal tetany, peripheral edema or diastolic hypertension. <br> <br> Labs in patients with hyperaldosteronism will show hypokalemia, hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and an increased aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio. The latter occurs because aldosterone is being inappropriately secreted while renin is being suppressed via negative feedback inhibition. <br> <br> The diagnosis is supported with CT or MRI scanning which may reveal an adrenal mass or enlarged adrenal glands consistent with adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal tumors are best treated with laparoscopic or open adrenalectomy while bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is best treated with spironolactone or other aldosterone receptor blockers.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Hypokalemia and hypernatremia, not hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, occur in patients with hyperaldosteronism because of increase sodium reabsorption.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Metabolic alkalosis, not acidosis, occurs in patients with hyperaldosteronism as a result of increased bicarbonate reabsorption.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Aldosterone: renin ratios are increased in patients with hyperaldosteronism because aldosterone is being inappropriately secreted while renin is being suppressed via negative feedback inhibition.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Hypernatremia, not hyponatremia occurs in patients with hyperaldosteronism because of increase sodium reabsorption.<br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: Labs in patients with hyperaldosteronism will show hypokalemia, hypernatremia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and an increased aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio. <br> <br><br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>COMLEX Level 2 CE Insight: Interpreting lab values for specific pathologies is an important concept that will allow you to correctly diagnose certain conditions.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism" target="_search">Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 6/20/2017</em></span>

Hairy cell leukemia is a malignant disorder of well-differentiated B-lymphocytes. It is a rare disease that accounts for less than 2% of adult leukemia cases which usually affects the elderly male population. HCL often presents with splenomegaly, weakness, fatigue, petechiae, abdominal pain, early satiety and weight loss. Symptoms are similar to those seen in patients with CLL except that HCL patients rarely have lymphadenopathy. HCL is diagnosed based on history, physical exam and labs but the diagnosis is confirmed through the identification of hairy cells (see below) in the blood, blood marrow or spleen. TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) staining and flow cytometry are helpful in distinguishing the pathognomonic hairy cells. Peripheral smear shows hairy cells, also described as mononuclear cells with abundant pale cytoplasm and cytoplasmic projections. Ten percent of patients with HCL will never require treatment as they have a benign disease course. However, treatment should begin when patients become symptomatic or cytopenic.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 63-year-old male presents to the emergency department after coughing up several teaspoons of blood and blood-tinged sputum. History reveals associated shortness of breath a sinus infection for the past month that has failed to improve with antibiotics. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and occasionally drinks alcohol. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 144/90 mmHg, a pulse of 80/min, a temperature of 38.0ºC (100.4ºF), and a respiratory rate of 14/min. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds over the right middle lobe and left lower lobe as well as dullness to percussion in these areas. Mild wheezing is appreciated over the central anterior chest wall. A chest radiograph reveals several large nodular lesions, some with central cavitation, and areas of diffuse alveolar opacity.

GPA, formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis, is a necrotizing vasculitis of small vessels, affecting predominantly the upper airways, tracheobronchial tree, and renal glomeruli. The first-line treatment for GPA is a combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids for induction of remission. Rituximab can be used in place of cyclophosphamide with high dose corticosteroids.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; D &amp; E:</strong> Antibiotics, dialysis, and intravenous immunoglobulin are not indicated in the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis; however, patients may require dialysis in late disease if it leads to renal failure.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> As described above, the first line treatment for GPA is a combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Since the introduction of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of this disease, mortality has substantial improved. Corticosteroids alone only increase survival by a mean of approximately eight months and are not the appropriate choice.<br><br><br><strong>Answer F:</strong> GPA must be distinguished from Goodpasture syndrome, another inflammatory disease with both renal and pulmonary manifestations. Goodpasture syndrome requires more aggressive therapy with plasmapheresis in addition to cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the triad of (1) diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, (2) rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and (3) the presence of circulating anti-basement membrane autoantibodies. A positive c-ANCA and mild pulmonary and renal manifestations point towards the diagnosis of GPA, not Goodpasture syndrome.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The treatment of GPA is with a combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/332622-overview" target="_search">"Wegner Granulomatosis" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/3/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 50-year-old female presents to the Emergency Department with the complaints of fever, body aches, and left-sided back pain for 1 day. Past medical history is remarkable for poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 88/55 mmHg, a heart rate of 120/min, a respiratory rate of 30/min, an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination reveals an ill-appearing female with an unremarkable HEENT exam, a supple neck, clear breath sounds, and no abdominal tenderness. There is severe tenderness with percussion of the left costovertebral angle. Laboratory analysis is remarkable for a serum leukocytosis of 15,000 cells/uL and &gt;100 WBC/HPF detected on urinalysis.

In adults, a typical appropriate fluid challenge is 2 liters of crystalloid (saline or lactated ringers). Sepsis is defined as the presence of SIRS (requires 2/4 criteria met) and evidence of infection. This patient has septic shock due to meeting sepsis criteria and continued hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a syndrome characterized by the development of progressive dysfunction in two or more organ systems that is induced by a variety of acute insults to the body. MODS is an ongoing process rather than a single event and can vary widely from a mild organ dysfunction to irreversible organ failure. This patient likely has acute pyelonephritis as the insult to her body and physiology. However, she is only manifesting one organ system dysfunction: hypotension. Progression to altered mental status, renal insufficiency, or evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) would indicate another organ system dysfunction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Sepsis is defined as the presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [requires 2/4 criteria met: 1) temperature &lt; 36ºC or &gt; 38ºC, 2) respiratory rate &gt; 20/min (or PaCO2 &lt;32 mmHg), 3) heart rate &gt; 90/min, and 4) WBC &lt; 4,000 cells/uL or &gt;12,000 cells/uL (or with &gt;10% bands)] and evidence of infection. This patient is presenting with 4 out of 4 SIRS criteria: tachypnea, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and fever. She also has evidence of an infection by physical exam and urinalysis. By the available data, this patient meets criteria for sepsis. However, she also has hypotension and has not been responsive to initial fluid resuscitation; therefore, she meets criteria for septic shock.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis complicated by end-organ dysfunction, as signaled by altered mental status, hypotension, elevated creatinine, or evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This patient is presenting with 4 out of 4 SIRS criteria: tachypnea, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and fever. In addition, she has a focus of infection (urine) and is hypotensive. This patient is further down the spectrum of illness than severe sepsis due to her persistent hypotension.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Only two of the four following criteria are required to make the diagnosis of SIRS. SIRS is a normal reaction to an insult/stress on the body and it is sensitive for detecting a stress response, but is nonspecific to the cause. SIRS does not always equal infection. For example, pancreatitis can cause SIRS. This patient has SIRS, although has a better definable clinical syndrome due to her hypotension despite fluids.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Septic shock is defined hypotension resulting in inadequate tissue/organ perfusion in the setting of sepsis that persists after appropriate fluid resuscitation.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/168402-overview" target="_search">"Septic Shock" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

This is an idiopathic disease most commonly occurring in the African-American population. It is commonly found incidentally on chest radiograph but may also present with systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, and weakness. In the above scenario the patient presents with blurred vision is a manifestation of anterior uveitis and the nodules on her legs are characteristic of erythema nodosum. These are two classic extrapulmonary findings of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is associated with characteristic chest radiograph findings. In the first stage, bilateral hilar adenopathy is appreciated. In the second stage, the hilar adenopathy is still present as are infiltrates. The third stage reveals lung involvement only with resolution of the hilar adenopathy. Lastly, the fourth stage reveals chronic lung scarring. Non-caseating granulomas, as seen on biopsy, are highly suggestive of the diagnosis as the diagnosis is primarily made clinically. Elevated serum ACE levels are appreciated in up to 50% of patients with sarcoidosis.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Sarcoidosis is associated with non-caseating granulomas on tissue biopsy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Sarcoidosis is a restrictive lung disease, characterized by normal to slightly elevated FEV1/FVC ratios. Remember, FEV1/FVC ratios are decreased in obstructive lung processes.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Diffuse alveolar damage is associated with respiratory distress syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Hyperplasia of mucus glands is associated with chronic bronchitis.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 37-year-old male presents to the office with the complaint of polyuria, polydipsia and weight gain. He tells you he gets little exercise and eats a poor diet. Physical examination is unremarkable. Initial labs reveal a fasting blood glucose of 156 and 164 on two separate occasions, a HbA1C of 12.2%, a BUN of 45 and creatinine of 4.7. The best initial treatment for this patient’s condition is</div><br>

This patient has symptoms of hyperglycemia. Polyuria occurs secondary to increased glucose levels being processed by the kidneys, which leads to an osmotic diuresis. Polydipsia occurs secondary to the osmotic diuresis as an attempt to rehydrate. Type II DM is diagnosed with a fasting glucose level greater than 126 on two separate occasions, a random glucose greater than 200 with symptoms of hyperglycemia or with a two-hour postprandial glucose level greater than 200. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) now suggests using a HbA1C of greater than 6.5% as criteria for diagnosing diabetes. The preprandial glucose goal for diabetics is 90-130 while the postprandial goal level is &lt; 180. According to the ADA the goal HbA1C for diabetics is &lt; 7.0%. Lifestyle interventions such as weight loss, exercise and diet modifications are considered first line treatments. The cornerstone of medical therapy for diabetes is metformin. It is usually well tolerated and the most common side effects are gastrointestinal in nature. Severe renal dysfunction (GFR less than 30 mL/min) is a contraindication to the use of metformin. Abnormal BUN and Cr can also be indicative of renal dysfunction that precludes the use of metformin. The American Diabetes Association recommends using insulin as a first line medication in patients with a HbA1C greater than 10.0%.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B &amp; D &amp; E:</strong> Diet modification, weight loss and exercise are considered first line treatments for most patients with diabetes. However, in patients with a HbA1C greater than 10.0%, these treatments are unlikely to be effective and insulin therapy is recommended. Furthermore, metformin should not be used in patients with renal dysfunction.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Insulin is considered a first line medication in patients with a HbA1C greater than 10.0%.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Diabetes is a commonly tested subject.

While there are several causes of premature ovarian failure, one must rule out chromosomal abnormalities in a 16-year-old female. Turner’s syndrome is the most likely diagnosis given the constellation of elevated FSH, lack of breast development, and horseshoe kidney. Pubic and axillary hair development is typically normal in patients with Turner syndrome.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> CT Abdomen/Pelvis could be useful for identifying Müllerian structures; however, karyotyping would be the next best step given the many characteristics of Turner syndrome present in this patient. One would expect to find ovarian streaks in a Turner’s patient.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Serum beta-hCG is not indicated given the negative urine beta-hcg.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Serum prolactin would be the next step in the diagnostic work-up should the FSH have come back low or normal.

History reveals he is unable to walk more than a block without having to stop to catch his breath but he does not have symptoms at rest. He admits that he has not taken his hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide for the past week. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 14/min, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the lung bases with diminished breath sounds. Auscultation of heart reveals S1, S2, and S3. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. He has 1+ edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest radiography is obtained and revealed cephalization of the pulmonary vessels and bilateral pleural effusions.

Pleural effusions can be transudative, caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure with an intact capillary network, or exudative, caused by inflammatory or invasive processes that increase capillary permeability. Transudative effusions are protein poor filtrates of serum, whereas exudates are protein rich. The most common causes of transudative effusions are volume overloaded states: congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. Exudative effusions are seen with pneumonias and cancer. Sampling of the effusion and comparison to serum laboratories can provide insight into the etiology of the effusion. Light’s criteria states that an effusion is exudative if the ratio of pleural protein to serum protein is &gt;0.5, the ratio of pleural to serum LDH is &gt; 0.6, or if the absolute pleural LDH is &gt; 2/3 of the upper limit of normal for serum. Generally speaking, bilateral pleural effusions with symptoms of a CHF exacerbation can be managed by a trial of diuresis without thoracentesis or sampling of the pleural fluid.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D:</strong> These choices are all consistent with an exudative pleural effusion, not transudative.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Light’s criteria states that an exudative pleural effusion has either: a ratio of pleural protein to serum protein &gt;0.5, ratio of pleural to serum LDH &gt; 0.6, absolute pleural LDH is &gt; 2/3 of the upper limit of normal for serum.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>COMLEX Insight Light’s criteria for pleural effusions and the serum albumin ascites gradient are similar concepts that can help narrow down a differential diagnosis based on the composition of the fluid sample.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299959-overview" target="_search">"Pleural Effusion" on Medscape. </a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/24/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 73-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of urinary incontinence. History reveals that she experiences a sudden and strong urge to void. This is followed by leaking urine prior to reaching the toilet, then complete bladder emptying with conscious voiding.

Women who have had children, have particular comorbid conditions (i.e., diabetes, neurologic disease), and are over age 65 years are at increased risk for incontinence. Urge incontinence occurs when involuntary leakage is accompanied by urgency and need to “rush to the toilet.” Stress incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine with effort, exertion, sneezing, or coughing. Mixed incontinence is combined urge and stress incontinence. Incomplete emptying can result in overflow incontinence. The patient described above is experiencing urge incontinence, which is most commonly the result of detrusor overactivity.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; B:</strong> Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia can result in bladder outlet obstruction.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 5-year-old male presents to the emergency department with the complaints of several days of high fever and rash. History reveals he was previously healthy until six days prior when he developed a fever of 104 ºF (40 ºC). Vital signs reveal a temperature of 103 ºF (39.4 ºC), a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 120 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 26/min.

The most appropriate treatment is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">high dose aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">hospitalization with supportive care only</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">intravenous ceftriaxone</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">intravenous vancomycin</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">transfer to burn center for further care</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>Kawasaki's disease (KD) is an acute febrile vasculitic syndrome of early childhood also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. KD is a clinical diagnosis based on fever lasting longer than 5 days and 4 of the 5 following features: 1) Peripheral extremity involvement including erythema of the palms and soles, or desquamation of the finger and toe tips. 2) Polymorphous rash that is usually generalized. 3) Oropharyngeal involvement such as erythema, fissuring, crusting of the lips, or strawberry tongue. 4) Bilateral, nonexudative, painless conjunctival injection. 5) Acute nonpurulent cervical lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral. The patient in this scenario has prolonged fever, conjunctival injection, strawberry tongue, rash, and lymphadenopathy. He therefore meets clinical criteria for KD. Treatment consists of hospitalization, high dose aspirin, and intravenous&nbsp;immunoglobulin (IVIG)&nbsp;to prevent cardiac complications such as coronary artery aneurysm.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hospitalization is required for the treatment of Kawasaki disease, although supportive care only would not be sufficient to treat the disease adequately. To reduce the incidence of cardiac complications such as coronary artery aneurysm and myocardial infarction, the recommended treatment is high dose aspirin and IVIG.<br><br><br><strong>Answers C &amp; D:</strong> The signs and symptoms of KD have some overlap with those of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a toxin-mediated acute life-threatening illness, due to prior or current infection with either Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus. Treatment for this syndrome includes rapid removal of the source of infection (tampon, abscess) and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and penicillin/cephalosporin). This patient does not have risk factors for either bacterial forms of TSS and has no desquamating rash associated. Importantly, this patient is hemodynamically stable, which is important in differentiating TSS from Kawasaki disease.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Transfer to a burn unit would be the appropriate treatment for toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). TEN is the most severe form of immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction and carries a high mortality (10-70%). The skin manifestation begins as a poorly defined, erythematous macular rash that may quickly form flaccid blisters and generalized epidermal detachment. Mucous membrane erosions generally precede the skin lesions by 1-3 days and most frequently affects the oropharynx, followed by the eyes and genitalia.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department for evaluation of <span class="Highlight">syncope</span>. History reveals he collapsed while running earlier that day and regained consciousness after a few moments. Review of systems reveals occasional chest pain and trouble breathing during baseball practice. Physical examination reveals an S4 gallop and a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border that is&nbsp;accentuated by standing and valsalva, and lessened by squatting, leg raising, and the handgrip maneuver.

It presents with the typical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (dyspnea on exertion, edema, etc.).  This would be highly unlikely in a healthy, young athlete with a negative past medical history.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy must be distinguished from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  While hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a congenital disorder and the most common cardiomyopathy in younger patients, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an acquired cardiomyopathy.  It is most often caused by long-standing, uncontrolled hypertension.  The heart becomes hypertrophied in order to pump against the high blood pressure.  As hypertrophy progresses, the heart stiffens and cannot relax completely during diastole eventually leading to heart failure.  It is unlikely that a patient of this age would have acquired hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> At first glance, seeing Q waves on the electrocardiogram may be worrisome for a myocardial infarction.  However, as stated above, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may commonly display Q waves in the inferior and lateral leads on electrocardiography.  These are "normal" in this condition and not indicative of a myocardial infarction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Restrictive cardiomyopathy results from the myocardium becoming infiltrated with substances that result in immobility and impairment in both systole and diastole. Diseases known to be associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy include scleroderma, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and endomyocardial fibrosis. Patients typically present with right sided-heart failure leading to jugular venous distension, ascites, edema, and hepatosplenomegaly.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiomyopathy in young patients. &nbsp;Look for a history of dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, syncope, or sudden cardiac death during exercise in a young person.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 67-year-old male presents to the clinic for routine examination. &nbsp;He has a past medical history of hypertension and a 35 pack-year <span class="Highlight">smoking</span> history.

It is used in the detection of small bowel bleeding, and is not a cancer screening method.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Colonoscopy is the best screening modality for colon cancer. According to the CDC, it is recommended every 10 years between the ages of 50 and 75. This patient had his last screening colonoscopy 5 years ago, and it was normal. He is not due for another colonoscopy for 5 years. Additional screening in other clinical situations is as follows:<br>

<br>

1) If there is a family history of familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner syndrome, a colonoscopy and genetic testing are recommended. Colonoscopy should be performed every 12 months beginning at age 10-12 years until age 35-40 years if negative. Because of the nearly 100% risk of developing cancer with familial adenomatous polyposis, total colectomy should be considered in the event of a positive colonoscopy.<br>

<br>

2) If there is a first-degree relative who was diagnosed with colon cancer or adenomas and age younger than 60 years, or with multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed at any age, the patient should have a colonoscopy every 3-5 years beginning at the age 10 years younger than the youngest affected relative does.<br>

<br>

3) Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer has a roughly 70% lifetime risk of developing cancer and thus patients in whom there is such a diagnosis should undergo colonoscopy every 1-2 years, beginning at the age of 20-25.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan is indicated for all women at the age of 65 to screen for osteoporosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A meningococcal vaccination is given routinely at the age 11 visit to the pediatrician.  This vaccination is also indicated for adults with the following circumstances: terminal compliment deficiency, residents of college dormitories, military recruits, asplenia, or travelers to Mecca or Medina in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj (pilgrimage).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>All male patients over the age of 65 with a smoking history should be screened with an abdominal ultrasound for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>The COMLEX will certainly be testing topics concerning preventative medicine. &nbsp;Being familiar with and reviewing these topics before test day will provide you with more confidence with your answers.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><br>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">An 8-month-old male is brought to the emergency department by his mother for fever and confusion. His mother states that he suffered a gastrointestinal illness with diarrhea and vomiting a few days ago. During that time, the boy was fussy but still somewhat playful and able to drink fluids. However, today he has been more lethargic and irritable. She noted that he had only 1-2 wet diapers in the past 24-hour period. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 102/68 mmHg, a heart rate of 100/min, a temperature of 38.6ºC (101.5ºF), and a respiratory rate of 18/min. There is scleral icterus and the abdomen is soft and non-tender. A urine sample is obtained by straight catheterization, revealing a small amount of dark-colored urine. Renal function tests reveal a BUN and creatinine of 33 mg/dL and 1.9 mg/dL, respectively. The most likely etiology of this patient’s current condition is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Campylobacter jejuni</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Escherichia coli 0157:H7</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Henoch-Schonlein purpura</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Shigella flexneri</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>This child most likely has hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is caused by infection with Escherichia coli 0157:H7. This particular strain of E. coli produces Shiga-like toxin, which causes colitis, allowing systemic absorption of both Shiga-like toxin and LPS from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These toxins promote inflammation and microthrombosis in the glomerular capillaries, leading to a local intravascular coagulopathy. Renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and destructive thrombocytopenia all result largely from these toxin-induced glomerular abnormalities and explain this patient’s clinical presentation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Campylobacter jejuni infection is associated with Guillain Barre Syndrome, not hemolytic-uremic syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by palpable purpura of the lower extremities as well as arthritis, arthralgias and renal failure. Approximately ½ of cases are preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, not a GI illness.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Infection with Shigella flexneri causes a hemorrhagic diarrhea, but it is not associated with a post-infectious acute hemolytic syndrome as seen in this patient. Shigella dysenteriae produces Shiga toxin and therefore may also cause with HUS; however, E. coli O157:H7 is the most common cause of HUS in the United States.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Staphylococcal enterotoxin leads to acute food poisoning but is not associated with HUS.<br><br><br><strong>Answer F:</strong> Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis may present with renal failure; however, the other features of this patient’s condition are not consistent with a post-streptococcal immune-mediated illness.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>The causative agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome is Shiga-like toxin, which is classically associated with a preceding colitis caused by E. coli O157:H7 infection.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/201181-overview" target="_search">Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/23/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 20-year-old male with no previous medical history presents to the office with a chief complaint of low back pain. History reveals the patient is a college student who plays in an intermural football team. The pain began after a strenuous practice about two months ago. It is worse with exercise and better with rest and ibuprofen. A radiograph of the lumbar spine reveals a grade II spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1. The next best step in management is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">bed rest and lumbar bracing to prevent flexion</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">exercise program to strengthen abdominal muscles and decrease lumbar lordosis</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">further imaging with a CT or MRI</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">surgical intervention since the patient has &gt;50% slippage of L5 vertebrae on S1</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">surgical intervention since the patient has &gt;75% slippage of L5 vertebrae on S1</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>Spondylolisthesis is a forward slippage of one vertebral body on the one below it. In the above scenario, the patient has L5 slippage on S1 vertebral body. Commonly, patients with spondylolisthesis will also have spondylolysis (unilateral or bilateral separation in the vertebral pars interarticularis; typically described as the collar around the neck of a "scottie dog" in an oblique lumbar spine x-rays). Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in young people often occurs among those who play sports that require repetitive flexion/extension of the spine such as gymnastics, volleyball, and football, as is the case with the patient in the above scenario. In the older population, spondylolisthesis occurs often due to the degenerative changes in the posterior facet joints and the disc. This eventually allows a "forward slippage" of the vertebra. Unlike the case above, in degenerative spondylolisthesis, slippage occurs most commonly at the level of L4 on L5. Physical examination may show localized pain in the low back especially with extension. Also, "step-down depression" of the spinous process at the effected level may exist. Neurological deficits are rare. The treatment options for spondylolisthesis often vary depending on the treating physician. However, most patients can be treated conservatively. Often patients are recommended a home exercise program or physical therapy that can strengthen the abdominal muscles, decrease lumbar extension and increase flexibility. Although OMT does not directly treat the defect, gentle OMT focusing on the hypertonic muscles as well as other somatic dysfunction can be helpful in relieving the patient's pain.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Often patients are recommended a home exercise program or physical therapy that can strengthen the abdominal muscles, decrease lumbar extension and increase flexibility.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Plain film is the best imaging choice for spondylolisthesis.  This should include lateral and oblique view.  Lateral view will show the pars defects as well as the anterior displacement of the vertebral body.  Oblique view will show the classic "collar of the Scottie dog." Although sensitive for spondylolysis, CT maybe be too costly with high radiation exposure for the patient.  MRI may be useful to visualize local soft tissue damage and edema, but unnecessary in this case<br><br><br><strong>Answers D &amp; E:</strong> Surgical intervention is indicated when patient shows neurologic deficit. Also surgery should be considered for patients with intractable low back pain often accompanied by radiculopathy into buttocks and posterior thigh. High-grade spondylolisthesis, with slip greater than 50%, commonly requires surgery. The patient in above case has grade II spondylolisthesis and does not have any neurologic deficits.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>For spondylolisthesis grade I and II (&lt;50% slippage) without neurological deficits, treatment is usually conservative including an exercise program and osteopathic manipulative treatment.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Spondylolisthesis can be graded based on the amount of anterior "slippage."

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 56-year-old male presents to the emergency department with the complaints of flu-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, and mild chest discomfort for the past 6 hours. History reveals he is a local goat farmer with a past medical history significant for hypertension, arthritis and basal cell carcinoma of the face. He denies sick contacts and is not a smoker. Physical examination reveals an oral temperature of 39ºC (102.2ºF) and clear lungs bilaterally on auscultation. An electrocardiogram is obtained and reveals sinus tachycardia at a rate of 106/min. A chest radiograph performed in the emergency department shows mediastinal widening without lobar or interstitial infiltrates. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is</div><br>

This gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus is known to infect sheep, goats, cattle and horses and can be transmitted to humans who handle sick animals or contaminated animal hides. The most common form of infection from Bacillus anthracis (95%) is cutaneous, with the inhalational form only comprising 5% of cases. Symptoms usually begin days after exposure and include flu-like symptoms, fever, chest discomfort and dyspnea. When spores are inhaled, they are ingested by pulmonary macrophages and are carried to the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. These lymph nodes become overwhelmed with infection and enlarge, seen as mediastinal widening on chest radiograph. Hemorrhagic mediastinitis, pulmonary edema and hemorrhagic pulmonary effusions can occur with inhalational anthrax. The mortality rate without treatment is 95%.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acute myocardial infarction (MI) may present with atypical symptoms including dyspnea, fatigue, low back pain and diaphoresis. It is not typical for patients with acute myocardial infarction to present with concomitant fever or without electrocardiographic changes consistent with myocardial infarction, therefore acute MI is not a likely answer.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Aortic dissection occurs when a false lumen is created within the wall of the aorta. Typically patients present with significant chest and back pain. Although a negative chest radiograph may be present, mediastinal widening is a component of thoracic aortic dissection. This patient's fever is not explained by aortic dissection making inhalational anthrax a more likely answer.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Community acquired pneumonia may present with fever, chills, dyspnea and chest discomfort, however, in the absence of lobar or interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph the diagnosis of pneumonia is less likely.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Left-sided congestive heart failure typically presents with dyspnea, dry cough and lower extremity edema along with pulmonary rales and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph.  This patient's symptoms along with the absence of pulmonary infiltrates makes congestive heart failure an unlikely answer choice.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Inhalational anthrax is an uncommon, usually fatal infection caused by inhalation of spores from Bacillus anthracis bacteria. Symptoms include a flu-like prodrome, chest discomfort and fever followed by rapid progression to respiratory failure or sepsis.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.emedicine.com/article/212127-overview" target="_search">"Anthrax" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

Examination findings include back pain, decreased range of motion in the spine, morning stiffness and occasionally, pain/inflammation in other joints (e.g. hip, knees, ankles). Physical exam findings include pain with back flexion, diminished range of motion, positive Schober test, positive FABER test. Diagnostic evaluation includes blood work (HLA-B27), x-ray and MRI. Treatment options include drug-modifying antirheumatologic drugs, TNF-blockers, NSAIDs, steroids and physical therapy.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This condition is associated with damage to the articular cartilage within joints. Morning stiffness can be present in many cases but it is usually monoarticular rather than polyarticular. Exam findings can include Heberden's nodules and Bouchard's nodules, as well as a decreased range of motion at the affected joint.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> This is a rheumatic condition associated with giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis). Patient's frequently present with chronic aching and morning stiffness in the shoulders, hip girdles, neck and torso.

CT will typically shows a homogeneous, ill-defined mesenteric mass with calcifications and a stellate or curvilinear fibrosis radiating from the mass.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> After a lesion is found, a biopsy may be obtained to confirm the histopathology of carcinoid tumor.  It should be noted, however, that a fine-needle biopsy of a liver metastasis might cause a carcinoid crisis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Plain chest radiography may have been warranted in this patient given his respiratory complaints; however, it is not indicated in the routine workup for carcinoid syndrome.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Urinary serotonin levels may be checked and are often elevated in carcinoid syndrome, however it has less diagnostic value and it is the metabolite of serotonin (5 HIAA) that is the best initial test.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Consider the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome in a patient with intermittent diarrhea, flushing, wheezing, and right-sided cardiac abnormalities. &nbsp;The best initial test is a 24-hour urinary 5 HIAA test.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/282515-overview" target="_search"><br>

Isoniazid is also known to cause peripheral neuropathies. &nbsp;This occurs because isoniazid depletes the body of vitamin B6 stores. &nbsp;Pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, is given with isoniazid to prevent this from occurring.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cobalamin is vitamin B12, which is an essential cofactor in various metabolic processes.

This generally benign, self-limited syndrome typically presents with autoimmune pleuritis, pneumonitis, or pericarditis characterized by fever and pleuritic chest pain, with onset up to 6 weeks' post-cardiac injury. This syndrome is thought to occur secondary to the presence of blood in the pericardial cavity, which occurs following cardiac surgery, cardiac trauma, or MI. The most effective therapy for this condition is treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID). Glucocorticoids are also used but are considered a second-line therapy.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Anxiety may be present but should not be assumed before other etiologies are ruled out.

The classic ECG finding of hypothermia is the Osborn wave (or prominent J wave), which is an extra positive deflection between the terminal portion of the QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment. The Osborn wave is usually positive in the left precordial leads, and has an amplitude that is inversely proportional to body temperature. Other ECG changes caused by hypothermia include prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QT intervals, T wave inversion, and bradyarrhythmias consisting of sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythms, or atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Profound hypothermia (core temperatures &lt; 32ºC) causes peripheral vasoconstriction, impaired enzymatic activity, decreased cardiac output, and reduced respirations. Complications of hypothermia include aspiration pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, rhabdomyolysis, acute tubular necrosis, gastric dilatation, upper GI bleed, hyperviscosity syndrome, and DIC.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Hyperkalemia will be characterized on ECG with reduced P waves and the development of peaked T waves. As the severity of hyperkalemia increases, the QRS will become widened and the ECG complex may evolve into a sinusoidal shape.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hypocalcemia will manifest with intermittent QT prolongation on ECG. This type of instability puts the patient at high risk for torsades de pointes.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> ST elevation and T-wave changes are classic findings for an acute myocardial infarction.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> The “S1Q3T3” pattern is characterized by a prominent S wave in lead I, Q and inverted T wave in lead III. This pattern is the classic finding seen in cases of pulmonary embolism. Ultimately, the right ventricle can enlarge causing a left deviation of the interventricular septum. This leads to the stretch of the right bundle branch resulting in a RBBB. If asked about the most common ECG finding with pulmonary embolism, however, (often a board favorite) the correct answer would be sinus tachycardia.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Osborn waves represent the classic ECG finding in patients suffering from hypothermia.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Be familiar with the classic ECG findings of the above conditions.

            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">chest CT</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">lumbar puncture</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">MRI of brain and spinal cord</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">muscle biopsy</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">upper endoscopy</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: A</div>The patient is suffering from myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors. It is characterized by weakness that worsens with use. Patients will often complain of diplopia, fatigue and periodic weakness. The symptoms improve when given edrophonium, a drug that blocks the action of acetyl cholinesterase. Myasthenia gravis is often associated with thymomas and thus after a diagnosis is made, a CT of the chest is mandatory. Myasthenia may resolve with thymectomy.<br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose meningitis and is helpful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis if oligoclonal bands are present.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> An MRI of the brain and spinal cord is useful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  Multiple plaques in the white matter will be present.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Muscle biopsy can be used in the diagnosis of certain myopathies; it is not needed to diagnose myasthenia gravis. The best test to diagnosis myasthenia is the anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Periodic monitoring by upper endoscopy is indicated for patients with scleroderma as they are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancers due to severe gastric reflux.  It is not needed in the initial work up of myasthenia gravis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>A thymoma needs to be ruled out in patients with myasthenia gravis.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 17-year-old female presents to the office with the complaints of difficulty concentrating and headaches. History reveals the patient sustained a blow to the top of her head by a softball during gym class. Physical examination reveals the patient has a decreased CRI at 7 cycles/min and her sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS) favors a flexion pattern. Which of the following is true regarding SBS flexion?</div><br>

Recall the coordination of cranial motion. In craniosacral flexion, the midline bones flex, sacrum counternutates, paired bones externally rotate and the AP diameter decreases. The head becomes wider and flatter. In extension, the midline bones extend, sacrum nutates, paired bones internally rotate, and the AP diameter increases. The head becomes longer and deeper.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> During craniosacral flexion, the AP diameter of the cranium decreases.

Peripheral smear shows microcytic (small) and hypochromic (large central pallor) red blood cells. &nbsp;Iron studies demonstrate low serum Fe, elevated TIBC, low Fe saturation, low ferritin,&nbsp;and low percent iron saturation. &nbsp;In fact, ferritin of less than 10 is specific for iron deficiency anemia. &nbsp;Hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal in iron deficiency anemia.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This clinical presentation depicts an acute drop in hemoglobin with evidence of GI blood loss, i.e. melena in a patient on both anti-platelet (aspirin) and anti-coagulation (Coumadin) in the setting of supra-therapeutic INR.  Anemia of chronic disease does not usually present as an abrupt drop in hemoglobin and usually does not present acutely with hemodynamic instability.  In addition, iron studies usually result in low serum iron, elevated ferritin, low TIBC, and low iron saturation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Hemolytic Anemia may result from congenital hemoglobin abnormalities, erythrocyte membrane abnormalities (i.e. Hereditary Spherocytosis), or abnormalities of the enzymes (i.e. G6PD) required for erythrocyte metabolism.  It is characterized by increased destruction of erythrocytes resulting in increased unconjugated bilirubin, LDH, uric acid, decreased level of haptoglobin (which is due to the binding of free hemoglobin in the blood causing a depletion of haptoglobin level).<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Thalassemia results from defects in the synthesis of either the alpha or beta chains, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis.  It's usually prevalent in Africa, Mediterranean, Middle East, and Asia.  Iron studies including serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, percent iron saturation are normal, which is not in this case.   Hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal for one and two gene deletions, and will be abnormal for four gene deletions.  The iron studies suggest Iron deficiency anemia and the hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal which goes against Thalassemia.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Folate and as well as Vitamin B12 deficiency usually result in macrocytic anemia not microcytic anemia which is present in this question stem.  Furthermore, the vitamin B12 level and folate level are within the normal range.  Vitamin B12 deficiency usually presents with neurological deficits including dementia and peripheral neuropathy.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>GI blood loss can result in Iron Deficiency Anemia which manifests as microcytic, hypochromic anemia, with low serum iron, elevated TIBC, low Fe saturation, and low ferritin.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/202333-overview" target="_search">"Iron Deficiency Anemia" on Medscape</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/3/2016</em></span>

Autonomic dysfunction can potentially involve any part of the sympathetic or parasympathetic chains and manifest in a myriad of ways. Symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis include heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting of undigested food (mostly occurring several hours after a meal), bloating, early satiety, and weight loss due to poor nutrient absorption combined with low-calorie intake. The above patient has several of these findings and clinical suspicion should be based on the patient’s history of taking metformin, implying a history of diabetes.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Celiac disease is a genetic malabsorptive disorder characterized by gluten intolerance. Symptoms of celiac disease in adults include diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, and feelings of bloating.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Diverticular disease results from outpouchings of colonic mucosa and submucosa through the muscular layer of the intestine. Risk factors include a high fat, low fiber diet and being over 60 years of age. Patients are usually asymptomatic but may experience constipation and lower abdominal pain.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Although heartburn is significant with GERD, the additional symptoms presented in the case are inconsistent with this diagnosis. In patients with GERD, expect to get a history of dyspepsia 30-90 minutes following meals, regurgitation, and pain worse in the supine position but improved with standing.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Post-obstructive ileus also results in slow transit times and delayed gastric emptying but is most common in the days following surgery.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Gastroparesis is an autonomic sequella of diabetes that most commonly presents with dyspepsia, vomiting of undigested food early feelings of fullness, and weight loss due to poor nutrient absorption combined with low-calorie intake.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Gastroparesis should be considered in any patient with known diabetes mellitus who presents with abdominal symptoms.

The drug works by accelerating gastric emptying time, which promotes motility of the GI tract. Metoclopramide is also an effective treatment for GERD, because of its ability to increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure to help reduce reflux of gastric contents.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Cimetidine (Tagamet) inhibits histamine at H2 receptors of gastric parietal cells, leading to reduced gastric acid secretion, gastric volume, and concentrations of hydrogen ions. H2 blockers have not been shown to be beneficial for patients suffering from gastroparesis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Placing the patient on a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole (Prilosec) would be inappropriate. These agents inhibit gastric acid secretion through H+/K+ ATPase enzymatic inhibition in the gastric parietal cells and are useful in cases of severe esophagitis and in patients who fail to respond to H2 receptor antagonist therapy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Ondansetron (Zofran) is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is a powerful antiemetic but does not promote bowel motility or increase gastric emptying, two of the most important effects needed to appropriately treat the above patient. Ondansetron works by reducing vagal activity and blocks serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> A second drug that has also shown to be beneficial in patients suffering from gastroparesis is erythromycin, not streptomycin as suggested by this answer.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>All patients suffering from diabetic gastroparesis should be placed on either metoclopramide or erythromycin to promote gastrointestinal motility and increase gastric emptying time.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Although ondansetron is used as a distractor in the above case, it is one of the most highly tested drugs on COMLEX. You will typically be presented with a case where a patient is receiving chemotherapy and suffers from refractory nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron&nbsp;will be the best antiemetic in this scenario.</em><br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-autonomic-neuropathy-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract?source=search_result&amp;search=gastroparesis&amp;selectedTitle=1~74" target="_search">"Diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the gastrointestinal tract" on UpToDate.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 10/2/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 36-year-old female presents to the office with the complaints of neck and shoulder pain and a burning sensation over her outer arm. History reveals the symptoms began two months ago and has come and gone for several weeks, but now it is constant. On physical examination, there is weakness with left wrist extension. The most appropriate test to aid in the diagnosis is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Lachman’s test</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">McMurray’s test</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Neer’s test</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Spurling’s test</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Thompson test</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>This patient is suffering from cervical radiculopathy. The most common level involved is C5-C6. Cervical disc herniation is a common cause of impingement on the cervical nerve roots, causing radicular symptoms. When the C5-C6 disc herniates, it impinges the C6 nerve root causing pain in the neck, shoulder, lateral arm and radial forearm. It can cause weakness in the wrist extensors, brachioradialis and a decreased or absent biceps reflex. One test that can be performed as part of the physical exam is the Spurling test. This is done with the patient seated, then passively extending the neck and rotating it towards the side of the suspected radiculopathy and applying compression. If this maneuver recreates the patient’s symptoms, it suggests the cervical nerve roots are the source. Imaging studies and nerve conduction studies study should be performed next.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Lachman’s test evaluates the knee for a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The knee is placed into 30 degrees of flexion. The tibia is then translated anteriorly to asses for laxity and presence of end-point of the ACL.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> McMurray’s test evaluates the knee for a torn meniscus. The supine patient’s knee is flexed to 90 degrees with a valgus stress applied. Then, the knee is externally rotated and extended. A positive test is indicated by pain or a click.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> The Neer test is performed by having the patient fully pronate the affected arm, then forcefully flexing it.  This causes impingement of the rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space, causing pain.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Thompson’s test evaluates for a ruptured achilles tendon. The patient lies prone on the exam table, with their feet hanging over the end of the table while the physician squeezes the patient’s calf. Squeezing the calf shortens the muscle unit of the gastrocnemius and soleus, placing tension on the Achilles and plantar flexing the foot. A positive test is indicated by the lack of plantarflexion since the tendon is ruptured.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Cervical radiculopathy most commonly occurs at C5/C6 disc level and affects the C6 nerve root. Patients complain of neck and shoulder pain and may have weakness of the wrist extensors. The Spurling test recreates the symptoms.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy" target="_search">"Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy" on UpToDate.</a><br>Miller MD, Thompson SR, Hart JA, et al.

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus that infects epithelial cells and disrupts the bonds that normally hold them together. The skin lesions are slightly umbilicated, dome-shaped, flesh-colored papules. Patients are usually asymptomatic. It can be transmitted by direct skin contact, e.g., children sharing a bath, daycare centers, or gymnasiums. In adults, it is considered a sexually transmitted disease and papules usually occur in the genital region. Scratching or touching the papules can cause autoinoculation to another body part. Diagnosis is usually by clinical exam only, but if lesions are atypical, removal of a small lesion with a curette and histological examination can confirm. Infected cells will appear dark and round and disperse easily with pressure, unlike normal epithelial cells, which remain stuck together. Lesions are self-limiting, but can last up to 9 months.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Atypical lymphocytes are characteristic of infectious mononucleosis caused by Ebstein Barr virus. EBV infection usually begins with pharyngitis, fever, malaise, and fatigue. If treated mistakenly with ampicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis, a prolonged pruritic drug-related maculopapular rash can erupt. The papules described in this clinical vignette are not pruritic and the rash is not maculopapular, making this an unlikely cause.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Owl’s eye inclusion bodies are highly specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is a herpesvirus that is transmitted via sexual contact, breast milk, or respiratory droplets. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic and reactivation occurs in immunocompromised patients, e.g., transplant and HIV patients. There are a variety of clinical syndromes, including CMV retinitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and encephalitis. It can also cause a seronegative mono-like illness. Treat with ganciclovir.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Pseudohyphae and budding yeast are observed on KOH preparation and are indicative of candidiasis. Candida infections usually occur in moist areas such as skin folds, below the breasts, the vagina, and the axillae. Skin infections usually present as pink, circular, erythematous macules with smaller satellite lesions, unlike what is presented in this vignette.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Sarcoptes scabiei is a tiny mite that mates on the skin’s surface, then burrows into the stratum corneum and lays eggs. The burrowing leads to the pruritus that is common to Scabies. Erythematous, excoriated papules are observed on the hands, axillae, and genitals. Treat with permethrin.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus infection that causes self-limiting flesh-colored, slightly umbilicated, dome-shaped papules. Patients are usually asymptomatic. This virus is transmitted via direct contact with the lesions or fomites. In children, it can be transmitted at daycare or gymnasiums. In adults, it is considered a sexually transmitted disease and occurs in the genital region. If genital lesions are observed in children, child abuse must be suspected. It can be more disfiguring and common in immunocompromised populations. Diagnosis is usually clinical, however, characteristic Henderson-Paterson inclusion bodies can be observed upon histological examination.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/910570-overview" target="_search">"Molluscum Contagiosum" on Medscape.</a><br>Habif, TP. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Dermatology: A color guide to diagnosis and therapy.</span> 5th ed.

Since this is a self-limiting disease, observation is the best choice of “treatment”. Another treatment for children is curettage if the lesions persist or if there are not too many.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> This is the treatment of choice in adult patients with a high pain tolerance and is not usually recommended as a treatment for children.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Ganciclovir is used to treat CMV infections, not molluscum contagiosum.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> . Oral fluconazole is used to treat candidiasis and not molluscum contagiosum.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Permethrin cream is used to treat scabies, not molluscum contagiosum.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Treatment for molluscum contagiosum is commonly benign neglect, as the disease is self-limiting.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 12-year-old male presents to the office complaining of a sore throat and swollen tonsils that started suddenly two days ago. Vitals reveal a temperature of 39 ºC (102.2 ºF) blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, a heart rate of 100/min, and a respiratory rate of 16/min. Physical examination reveals tonsillar exudates and submandibular lymphadenopathy. There is a <span class="Highlight">fine, erythematous patch</span> on the chest, back, and upper extremities as shown in the exhibit. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">erysipelas</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">erythema multiforme</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">infectious mononucleosis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">roseola</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">scarlet fever</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>This patient has an acute exudative tonsillitis, fever, and submandibular lymphadenopathy, with no mention of cough. This is most consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. The presence of a rash suggests systemic involvement of the infection and is classic for scarlet fever. The rash is described as sandpapery, or as a fine erythematous punctate eruption that usually is present on the trunk and extremities. Scarlet fever is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and the release of erythemogenic/erythrogenic toxin causes the hallmark rash. It is treated with penicillin.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Erysipelas is a common bacterial skin infection most commonly due to streptococcus pyogenes. It involves the upper dermis and is described as a raised, sharply demarcated area of erythema with slowly advancing margins that is tender to palpation. It often involves the lymphatics, which causes “streaking”.  It is commonly seen on the face and extremities and follows a bacterial pharyngitis or trauma to the area.  This patient has a much different skin exam than a patient with erysipelas, although the etiology of the two is the same.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, self-limiting skin condition that is considered to be a type IV hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections and/or medications. The classic skin findings are target lesions, that are small, red, purpuric macules or plaques that most commonly occur on the extensor surfaces of extremities and the trunk. EM thought to be included in the spectrum of skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Infectious mononucleosis (mono) presents as fever, pharyngitis and adenopathy much like the patient in this scenario. However, mono is not typically associated with a fine erythematous rash. Mono patients misdiagnosed with group A streptococcal pharyngitis and treated with penicillin may develop a maculopapular rash, although this is not the case in this scenario. Mono is typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and treatment is supportive.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Roseola is a viral exanthem most commonly seen in children less than 2-years-old. It is caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and classically presents as a maculopapular rash that develops after the fever breaks. The acute illness of roseola includes several days of fever that may be accompanied by upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract symptoms.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Acute streptococcal pharyngitis accompanied by a fine, sandpapery, erythematous rash on the trunk or extremities is scarlet fever. It is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Familiarize yourself with all viral exanthems in childhood.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 55-year-old obese female presents to the office with a known history of diabetes mellitus. History reveals she is finding it more difficult to control her blood sugar despite taking her oral hypoglycemic medicines and watching her diet. She states when she takes her blood sugar at home her lowest measurement is 200 mg/dL and her highest is 300 mg/dL. &nbsp;Laboratory analysis reveals her&nbsp;HbA1c levels have been steadily increasing over the past three visits from 7.0 to 10.2.&nbsp;You obtain a serum C-peptide and find it to be lower than the normal range. This information indicates</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient has type I diabetes mellitus and needs to begin insulin therapy.</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient is in the “honeymoon” period of type I diabetes mellitus.</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient is a type II diabetic who needs to begin insulin therapy.</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient is a type II diabetic who needs to decrease her oral hypoglycemic therapy.</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">the patient is a type II diabetic who needs to increase her oral hypoglycemic therapy.</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: C</div>The C-peptide in this question is indicative of the amount of insulin being produced by the pancreas. In this case the patient has a low C-peptide which indicates low insulin production by the pancreas.&nbsp;Type II diabetic patients have developed an insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues; thus the pancreas will produce increased amounts of insulin causing the C-peptide to initially be high. Patients with type II diabetes, however, may also develop inadequate insulin production by the pancreas as their disease progresses as the pancreas becomes "burned out" from overproducing insulin in an attempt to compensate for the insulin resistance. Once pancreatic insulin production decreases, patients will present with uncontrolled glucose and HbA1c. The next step in treatment of these patients is to begin insulin therapy. Knowing the pathophysiology of the disease is essential to answering this question correctly.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> It is very unlikely that this patient has type I diabetes based on her age, body habitus, and drug regimen.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Again, it is unlikely that this patient has type I diabetes.  The "honeymoon" is the time period in which type I diabetic patient experiencing a “remission” phase that occurs a few days to a week after beginning treatment with insulin. Type I diabetic patients may have a normal C-peptide during their “honeymoon” period but will have a low C-peptide level throughout the rest of their life since deficient insulin production is the pathophysiology of this disease. During this time period, usually lasting a few months, the patient needs less insulin than will eventually be required.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> In order to better manage their diabetes, a patient with rising HbA1c needs to increase their diabetes medications whether it is the oral hypoglycemics or insulin therapy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Oral hypoglycemic agents work primarily by decreasing the body’s resistance to insulin and/or increasing endogenous release of insulin from the pancreas. Therefore increasing the dose of oral hypoglycemics in the hopes of increasing insulin production will likely be ineffective as the low C-peptide in this case indicate pancreatic "burn-out."<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Difficulty with blood glucose control using oral hypoglycemics in type II diabetics is an indication for the initiation of insulin therapy.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>COMLEX Level 2 CE Insight: It is important to have a strong understanding of diabetes mellitus including pathophysiology, genetics, treatments, and screening (eg: diabetic eye exams, urine microalbumin, and monofilament testing). Diabetes mellitus is important to board examiners because of its high prevalence as well as it being a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease (recall that diabetic patients can have "silent" ischemia or myocardial infarctions!). Know how to differentiate types I and II from each other and the difference of pathophysiology and genetics for each type. Also be aware of different terminology that may show up on the COMLEX. You may see insulin-dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes instead of types I and II. Keep in mind that non-insulin dependent diabetic patients are "type II", but insulin-dependent diabetic patients may be either "type I" or "type II".

This virus is widespread in the population, with antibodies found in 75% of healthy human sera. Disease, however, is found only in the immunocompromised, such as AIDS patients. The virus infects astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS white matter. PML affects only the white matter (thus the word leukoencephalopathy). The virus is very prevalent in the population, but it can be reactivated in patients taking specific immunomodulating drugs. PML is aggressive, and death usually occurs within six months.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> PML is an aggressive disease that can cause rapid decline and death.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> The JC virus is a DNA virus.  Measles virus is an RNA virus that can lead to long-term neurological symptoms (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> The JC virus affects oligodendrocytes.

Fat necrosis can mimic breast cancer in its clinical and radiographic examination because it often presents as a fixed, spiculated mass with nipple retraction and has evidence of calcification on mammogram and appears solid on ultrasound. The calcifications seen in this patient were described as “coarse,” which is more characteristic of benign lesions. Calcifications associated with breast malignancy tend to be “microcalcifications.” Fine-needle, core, or excisional biopsy is diagnostic and shows foamy macrophages and fat globules. Fat necrosis is not a premalignant lesion and most commonly resolves with time. The next best step is routine follow-up without intervention.<br><br><strong>Answers A &amp; C &amp; E:</strong> Surgical procedures would be indicated if the biopsy revealed breast carcinoma. There is no indication for surgery in treatment of a benign condition such as fat necrosis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> An MRI would not be useful in workup of fat necrosis. Remember that calcium does not magnetize; therefore, MRI is never appropriate in evaluation of calcifications found on mammogram.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Breast fat necrosis of the breast can mimic malignancy.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 63-year-old male presents to the office worried about a&nbsp;tremor in his right hand. His medical history is significant for hypertension,&nbsp;high cholesterol and hypothyroidism. On review of systems he admits to having intermittent nausea and feeling depressed. He says that the tremor started about one year&nbsp;ago. Initially it would occur infrequently and when he was at rest, but has&nbsp;worsened over the last few months to now where he it occurs almost constantly&nbsp;when he is sitting down. It has made it difficult to read the newspaper. On&nbsp;exam he does have a slow tremor in his right hand. He also seems to have less&nbsp;emotion in his face and decreased arm swing in his right arm when walking.&nbsp;Which of the following medications should be avoided in this patient?</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">amitriptyline</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">metoclopramide</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">ondansetron</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">promethazine</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">sertraline</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>The patient has parkinsonism; there is not enough&nbsp;information from this question stem to formally diagnose him with idiopathic&nbsp;Parkinson’s Disease (PD), but he has some hallmarks that can lead us down that&nbsp;path. He has risk factors for PD- age, gender and his symptoms are consistent&nbsp;with a typical initial presentation of PD- unilateral, slowly progressive&nbsp;tremor, decreased arm swing, flat facies. The hallmark pathologic finding in PD&nbsp;is depletion of dopamine from the substantia nigra. Any medications that are&nbsp;dopamine antagonists should be avoided. Metoclopramide is a commonly used anti-emetic medication. Its mechanism of&nbsp;action is the dopamine D2 receptor. Any medications that block dopamine should&nbsp;be avoided in PD.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It has a wide range of actions, the most prominent is inhibiting re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. It also has action at serotonin, histamine and adrenergic receptors. It has a wide range of uses including anti-depressant, chronic pain, migraine prevention and eating disorders to name a few. It does not have any dopaminergic effects and could be used in PD.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> blocking medication. It is used for nausea and vomiting. It does not have any effect on dopamine and can be safely used in PD.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Promethazine is a medication used for nausea and vomiting. It is an anti-histamine H1 blocking medication. It also has some anti-cholinergic effects. It does have some very weak affinity for D2 receptors and a side effect is dystonia. It should probably not be a first line anti-emetic in this patient, and should be used with caution.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Sertraline is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is used to treat depression. Depression is exceedingly common in patients with PD and should be asked about during every visit. SSRIs are first line therapy and should be offered to the appropriate patients. There is a theoretical interaction with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as both increase the amount of serotonin and can lead to serotonin syndrome. Selegiline and rasagiline are both MAOIs with affinity to the B receptor, and are frequently used in treatment of PD. This interaction is theoretical and the combination of an SSRI with an MAOI-B (especially at low doses) is common.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease include;&nbsp;unilateral, slowly progressive&nbsp;tremor, decreased arm swing, flat facies. Any medications that block dopamine should&nbsp;be avoided in PD.<br><br>For more information, see:<br>Le. T, Bhushan V, Hofmann J, et al.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 25-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of lower back pain. History reveals she has been a gymnast since the age of four. Physical examination reveals tight hamstrings bilaterally, bilateral lumbar paraspinal hypertonicity, and a straight leg raise test that reproduces her lower back pain bilaterally. Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine in the oblique view demonstrate a fracture of the pars interarticularis of L4 with the lumbar spine maintaining appropriate alignment. The most likely diagnosis is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">psoas syndrome</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">spinal stenosis</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">spondylolisthesis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">spondylolysis</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">spondylosis</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: D</div>Spondylolysis occurs when there is a defect in the pars interarticularis without displacement of the affected vertebra on top of the adjacent inferior vertebra. &nbsp;The pars interarticularis is the part of the vertebra that is located between the superior and inferior articular processes of the zygapophyseal joint. &nbsp;In order to obtain an adequate view of the pars interarticularis, plain radiographs must be taken in the oblique view. &nbsp;In the oblique view, a defect in the pars interarticularis may appear as a collar on the "Scottie dog." &nbsp;This is because the posterior elements form a silhouette of a Scottie dog when viewed obliquely.&nbsp; The transverse process represents the nose, the pedicle represents the eye, the superior articular facet represents the ear, the inferior articular facet represents the front leg, and the pars interarticularis represents the dog's neck. &nbsp;This defect is relatively common, appearing in up to 5% of the general population. &nbsp;Its prevalence is higher in patients who do repetitive back extension, such as gymnasts, as this increases the likelihood of fatigue fractures in the pars interarticularis. &nbsp;The most common vertebrae involved L4 or L5. &nbsp;Patients often present with the complaint of lower back, buttock, and/or posterior thigh pain that is described as an ache. &nbsp;The pain is typically increased with extension-based activities, and there are usually no neurologic deficits. &nbsp;Physical examination will likely reveal tight hamstrings bilaterally, and a stiff-legged, short stride, waddling gait. &nbsp;Treatment typically consists of activity modification, physical therapy, and analgesics as necessary.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Psoas syndrome is a clinical syndrome caused by a flexion contracture of the iliopsoas muscle complex. It often results from prolonged positions that shorten the iliopsoas complex, typically in those patients who have desk jobs. There are other possible organic causes, however, that may result in spasm of the iliopsoas complex through viscero-somatic or somato-somatic reflexes. These organic causes include salpingitis, ureteral calculi, ureter dysfunction, metastatic prostate carcinoma, appendicitis, or sigmoid colon dysfunction. These organic causes must be ruled out before beginning therapy for mechanical causes. Psoas syndrome typically presents as an ache or muscle spasm in the lower back that may sometimes radiate to the groin. The pain is typically increased when standing or walking. Physical examination will demonstrate a tender point medial to the ASIS, a positive Thomas test, a positive pelvic shift test to the contralateral side, non-neutral dysfunction of L1 or L2, sacral dysfunction on an oblique axis, and contralateral piriformis spasm. Acute spasm is typically treated with ice and indirect osteopathic manipulation techniques. Because stretching may cause further spasm in the acute phase, stretching should be limited to more chronic psoas spasms.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Spinal stenosis is the result of degenerative changes causing narrowing of the spinal canal or intervertebral foramina causing pressure on nerve roots, or the spinal cord itself.  These degenerative changes may include loss of intervertebral disc height, hypertrophy of the zygapophyseal joints, or calcium deposits within the ligamentum flavum and the posterior longitudinal ligament.  Patients typically complain of lower back pain that may radiate to the legs.  The pain is typically described as an aching lower back with shooting pain or paresthesias going down one or both legs.  The symptoms are usually worsened with extension, when standing, walking, or lying supine.  Treatment initially consists of activity modification, physical therapy, analgesics as necessary, and may progress to requiring epidural steroid injections, or surgical laminectomy with decompression.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Spondylolisthesis presents very similarly to spondylolysis, however plain radiography in the lateral view will demonstrate anterior displacement of one vertebra in relation to the adjacent inferior vertebra. Signs, symptoms, physical examination, and therapies are very similar to those of spondylolysis. An additional physical examination finding that may be seen in spondylolisthesis, but is not seen and spondylolysis, is a positive vertebral step off sign, which is noted when palpating the spinous processes, and there is an obvious forward displacement of one vertebra in relation to the inferior vertebra.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Spondylosis is simply a radiologic term for ankylosing of adjacent vertebral bodies and degenerative changes within the injured vertebral disc.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Spondylolysis is the term used to describe a defect in the pars interarticularis without anterior displacement of the affected vertebra in relation to the adjacent inferior vertebra.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Spondylosis, spondylolysis, and spondylolisthesis are very similar terms that are easily tested on the COMLEX exam. &nbsp;Be sure to know the difference between these definitions.</em><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/25/2016</em></span>

Past medical history reveals hyperlipidemia, hypertension and a deep vein thrombosis two months ago, for which the patient takes lisinopril, lovastatin and enoxaparin. The patient has not taken any medications in the last 24 hours. The patient should receive which of the following before surgery to prevent hypertensive crisis?</div><br>

The stress of the operation and manipulation of the tumor can cause a massive release of catecholamines and lead to a hypertensive crisis if not treated beforehand. Alpha-blockers prevent norepinephrine from binding to vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> The patient in the above scenario does not need fresh frozen plasma. Low molecular weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, have a short half-life and unlike warfarin, only need to be stopped a day prior to surgery.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> This patient does not need presurgical anticoagulation.  His enoxaparin should be restarted after surgery.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Lisinopril will not help in preventing a hypertensive crisis from a pheochromocytoma, as it does not block alpha-receptors.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can be used in addition to an alpha-blocker during surgery for a pheochromocytoma. However, due to beta-2 mediated vasodilation it should not be given before an alpha-blocker because it can worsen a hypertensive crisis<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Patients with pheochromocytomas need to receive alpha-blockers before surgery to remove the tumor.<br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/24/2016</em></span>

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 49-year-old male presents to the emergency department by ambulance. Paramedics report that approximately thirty minutes prior he developed slurred speech, right facial droop, and weakness to his right side. He cannot articulate his complaints, but can appropriately answer “yes/no” questions with a head nod. His past medical history reveals obesity, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type-2 diabetes. Vitals reveal a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg, a heart rate of 75/min, a respiratory rate of 16/min, an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air, and a temperature of 37 °C (98 °F). Physical examination reveals right extremity weakness and an asymmetric face when asked to smile. The most important initial step in management is</div><br>

In addition, he is high risk due to his history of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset, and therefore should be evaluated emergently so that he may receive thrombolytics if he qualifies and has no contraindications. This patient's presentation is consistent with a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) that involves the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. This type of CVA will commonly cause an expressive aphasia due to ischemia to Broca’s area. In addition, right-sided weakness is indicative of a left MCA territory infarct. The most important initial study to obtain is a non-contrast enhanced brain CT. The importance of CT in acute stroke is not to detect the presence of visible infarcted brain tissue, but to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarct, so that thrombolytics can be given with least amount of risk of bleeding complications. In fact, the overall sensitivity of CT for ischemic stroke in the emergency department is around 16%, making it a poor test to detect ischemic stroke.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Bell’s palsy is a peripheral nerve palsy due to inflammation on or around cranial nerve VII (facial nerve). This nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen as it exits the skull and supplies motor function to the facial muscles and taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Importantly, a patient with Bell’s palsy will have complete hemiparesis of their face (upper and lower portions), whereas in acute MCA territory infarct, the paralysis will only be to the lower portion of the contralateral face. This question stem does not specifically indicate which portion of the face is paralyzed, however Bell’s palsy will never cause speech disturbances or other extremity weaknesses because it is limited to one lower motor neuron. Bell’s palsy is thought to be due to herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), and is usually treated with steroids and acyclovir, but is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is indicated in acute ischemic infarct within 3 hours of symptom onset in patient's 18-years of age or older. Contraindications to t-PA are CT evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or hypodensity in over 1/3 of the MCA territory, systolic BP &gt; 185 or diastolic &gt; 110 Hg despite aggressive management, headache or stiff neck suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial tumor, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm, or any evidence of active GI bleeding. This patient has not yet received a brain CT to evaluate for intracranial bleeding or other pathology as listed above. Therefore, administration of t-PA as an initial management strategy is incorrect and could cause disastrous results if there is intracranial bleeding, aneurysm, tumor or arteriovenous malformation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> There is a lack of evidence to whether lowering blood pressure in acute CVA is beneficial. In fact, some data may suggest that lowering blood pressure may be harmful because of the decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (defined as mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure). At this point, the blood pressure may be due to stress/anxiety/pain and should be addressed at some point. It should not interfere with obtaining a STAT brain CT.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> CT angiography (CTA) is commonly used in the workup of CVA after an initial non-contrast brain CT is obtained. At most centers, the order of operation for suspected ischemic stroke amenable to tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is as follows: 1) non-contrast brain CT, 2) CTA, 3) t-PA, 4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If there is any sign of bleeding on the initial brain CT, there is an absolute contraindication for t-PA administration. CTA is used following the non-contrast CT to evaluate for focal vessel obstruction that may be amenable to coiling or direct arterial thrombolysis by interventional radiology/neurosurgery. This patient should undergo non-contrast enhanced brain CT as a first step in management.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Signs and symptoms of acute stroke include the acute onset of any focal neurologic findings. In general, 80% of strokes will be ischemic and 20% hemorrhagic. Maintain a high level of suspicion and get a non-contrast enhanced brain CT immediately to evaluate for hemorrhagic infarct or subarachnoid hemorrhage before giving t-PA.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916852-overview" target="_search">"Ischemic Stroke in Emergency Medicine" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/22/2016</em></span>

An elevated alpha-fetoprotein level without other laboratory abnormalities is commonly due to inaccurate dating. In the above scenario an ultrasound has been obtained to rule this out. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein may also be elevated due to neural tube defects. Spina bifida is a common neural tube defect characterized by failure of the lamina of a vertebral segment to close. These usually occur in the lumbar spine. This can be benign (occulta) or cause serious neurological damage if the spinal cord herniates.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> A defect in the pars interarticularis of the lumbar spine is associated with spondylolysis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> A sacrococcygeal teratoma is a germ cell tumor common in neonates but does not fit with the findings in this case.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Trisomy 21 leads to Down’s syndrome which may present with a decreased alpha fetoprotein during pregnancy.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Alpha fetoprotein is decreased in trisomy 18.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Lack of folic acid during pregnancy and elevated alpha fetoprotein are associated with neural tube defects.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 30-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a one week history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. History reveals the abdominal pain has been gradually worsening over the past week, and is currently a 10/10 in intensity. She has also noted bright red blood in her stool for 5 days' duration. Her nausea and vomiting began late last night. Past medical history is significant for <span class="Highlight">ulcerative colitis</span> and medications include sulfasalazine and an over-the-counter multivitamin. She smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and drinks alcohol socially. She recently returned from a trip to Indonesia. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg, a heart rate of 110/min, a temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F), and a respiratory rate of 18/min. Physical examination reveals her abdomen is exquisitely tender in all 4-quadrants and there is guarding and rebound tenderness. An abdominal radiograph is obtained as shown in the exhibit.

Abdominal pain suggests a possible complication of this patient's ulcerative colitis, such as perforation or toxic megacolon. Patients usually present with a 1-week history of bloody diarrhea symptoms that are not responsive to medication. On exam, patients are often tachycardic, febrile, and hypotensive. Abdominal exam will usually reveal abdominal tenderness and distention and peritoneal signs are often present. Bowel sounds will be decreased or absent. On plain film, such as shown above, the transverse colon is very dilated, usually greater than 6 centimeters. Toxic megacolon is a very serious complication and mortality rate is around 40%. Approximately 50% of patients may improve with medical management, such as bowel rest, intravenous steroids, antibiotics, and fluids. However, if clinical status continues to deteriorate, immediate surgery with total colectomy is often indicated.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Acute flares of ulcerative colitis usually consist of bloody diarrhea with rectal urgency, discomfort, and cramps.

He states that his discharge has been present ever since being placed on a new medication by his psychiatrist. The patient is unable to recall the name of the pill he is taking.

            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Fluoxetine</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Haloperidol</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Lithium</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Nortriptyline</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">Phenelzine</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: B</div>Haloperidol is characterized as a typical antipsychotic and is commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia. One of its notable side effects is hyperprolactinemia, which occurs due to its dopamine-inhibiting effects allowing for the oversecretion of prolactin. Increased prolactin levels may cause abnormal breast swelling and lactation. Normally, dopamine blocks the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. When dopamine release is blocked by drugs such as haloperidol, the blockade on prolactin release is lost, leading to increased prolactin levels.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.  It blocks the re-uptake of serotonin in the presynaptic cleft.  It is used as the first-line treatment for depression and requires approximately 4-8 weeks of administration before seeing its' effect.  These drugs have been shown to be helpful for bulimia and anxiety.  Adverse reactions include sexual dysfunction (secondary to serotonin levels) and increased risk of suicidal ideation in adolescents.  They can cause serotonin syndrome, which can be treated with cyproheptadine.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Lithium is a mood stabilizer commonly used to treat bipolar disorder may adversely lead to excessive thirst, polyuria, hypothyroidism, weight gain, and tremor. Lithium use in pregnancy has been associated with Ebstein's anomaly in the fetus.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that blocks the re-uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.  It is used for second-line treatment for depression.  It is fatal at only 5 times the therapeutic dose due to cardiac QT prolongation.  Its main side effects are weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and anticholinergic symptoms.<br><br><br><strong>Answer E:</strong> Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.  It inhibits the deamination of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.  It is used as a second line treatment for depression.  Adverse effects include dizziness and hypertensive crisis (secondary to consumption of foods containing tyramine).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Hyperprolactinemia is a known side effect of haloperidol, which occurs due to its dopamine-inhibiting effects thus causing a oversecretion of prolactin.<br><br><strong>COMBANK Insight : </strong><em>Basic physiology is not commonly tested unless it is associated with pathophysiology or a side effect of a medication.

            <div class="QuestionBody" style="font-family: verdana;">A 55-year-old female presents to the emergency department with the complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting. Further history reveals that she began having diffuse abdominal pain two days ago and has not been able to eat or drink anything since that time. She reports bilious, non-bloody emesis up to five times per day. She has a past medical history of alcoholism and endometriosis. Past surgical history is pertinent for a femoral hernia repair and laparoscopic endometrial ablation, both several years ago. Vitals reveal a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg, a heart rate of 90/min, a respiratory rate of 24/min, and a temperature of 37ºC (98.6ºF). Physical examination reveals an uncomfortable but non-toxic appearing woman. Her abdomen is distended, resonant to percussion, and diffusely tender to palpation. An abdominal radiograph is obtained as shown in the exhibit. The most appropriate intervention is</div><br>
            <div>1. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">attempt manual disimpaction of colon</span><br>2. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">consult gastroenterology</span><br>3. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">give stimulant laxative to facilitate peristalsis</span><br>4. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">obtain stool sample and send for clostridium difficile toxin</span><br>5. <span class="AnswerChoiceText">place nasogastric tube</span><br></div><br><span class="Explanation" style="display: block;"><div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The correct answer is: E</div>This patient has a history of two prior abdominal surgeries which places her at increased risk of small bowel obstruction (SBO). This patient’s physical exam is notable for a tender, tympanitic abdomen and she has an abdominal radiograph showing air-fluid levels that is consistent with SBO. SBOs can be partial or complete depending on the degree of obstruction. They are also described as simple or strangulated depending on evidence of inadequate bowel perfusion. Strangulated obstructions are surgical emergencies due to potential vascular compromise that can lead to bowel ischemia/necrosis. The most common causes of SBO is prior abdominal surgery (adhesions), hernias, inflammatory bowel disease, and malignancy. If the abdominal radiograph fails to adequately show a small bowel obstruction, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated to further elucidate the cause of and location of the obstruction. In addition to providing intravenous fluids and anti-emetics, the most appropriate initial treatment is decompression of the gastrointestinal tract with a nasogastric tube (NGT). Often a conservative, nonoperative approach such as NGT placement is tried for several days assuming the patient is hemodynamically normal and improving with this therapy.<br><br><strong>Answer A:</strong> Severe constipation is a common cause of abdominal pain and can be treated by manual disimpaction. However, this patient does not report a history of constipation nor has an abdominal radiograph showing colonic distention consistent with constipation. This radiograph shows air-fluid levels in the small bowel consistent with SBO. Manual disimpaction would not provide this patient any benefit.<br><br><br><strong>Answer B:</strong> SBO is generally managed by internal medicine and general surgery. Rarely does gastroenterology become involved at all in these cases because gastroenterology can do little to affect the patient’s outcome in the acute setting. The patient will either improve with NGT therapy (nonoperative) or will need surgery to correct the problem. General surgery should be consulted early if there are signs of bowel strangulation and tissue ischemia such as tachycardia, fever, or signs of peritonitis.<br><br><br><strong>Answer C:</strong> Stimulant laxatives are contraindicated in SBO or in any setting where mechanical obstruction is in the differential. Giving a patient a stimulant laxative will cause increased peristalsis of the bowel and cause increased pressure on the point of obstruction. This can cause worsening of the SBO, propagate strangulation/tissue ischemia and can even cause intestinal perforation.<br><br><br><strong>Answer D:</strong> It is unlikely that this patient is suffering from clostridium difficile colitis by history and physical exam. Patient’s with this condition have voluminous, foul-smelling diarrhea and have abdominal radiographs showing distention of the colon. Often they have recently been prescribed antibiotics. A potentially life threatening complication of clostridium difficile colitis is toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon is described as a syndrome of non-obstructive colonic dilatation larger than 6 cm and signs of systemic toxicity. The radiograph in this scenario shows dilated loops of small-bowel and air-fluid levels that is consistent with SBO, not colitis.<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Bottom Line: </strong>In small-bowel obstruction, initiate care by decompressing the bowel with the placement of a nasogastric tube. Recognize SBO on abdominal radiography by the presence of air-fluid levels.<br><br>For more information, see:<br><a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/774140-overview" target="_search">"Small-Bowel Obstruction" on Medscape.</a><br><br><br><em>Last Updated: 9/21/2016</em></span>
