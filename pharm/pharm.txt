<p id="riluzole">Riluzole is a medication used to slow the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It is an antagonist of the glutamate pathway and has shown to reduce excitability. Riluzole is the only medication that has shown to increase survival in patients with ALS. However, ALS is incurable and average span of disease is approximately 3 years from onset of symptoms.</p>


<p id="esomeprazole">Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. These medications inhibit the hydrogen-potassium ATPase pump by irreversibly binding to it.  For patients that are acutely ill, intravenous PPI therapy is the first step in attempt to control the acid secretion. PPI's are superior to histamine 2 receptor blockers for the control of gastric acid hypersecretion.</p>

<p id="octreotide">Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that is effective at controlling the symptoms of gastrinomas in a patient with unresectable tumor. There is some evidence that the drug is able to reduce gastrin levels and may slow tumor growth. This patient presents with acute exacerbation of peptic disease, therefore a proton pump inhibitor is immediately indicated.</p>

<p id="zollingerEllison_overview">Zollinger Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is caused by a non-beta islet, gastrin secreting tumor of the pancreas. This tumor stimulates the acid-secreting cells of the stomach causing gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration. Primary ulcerations, severe gastric acid hypersecretion,&nbsp;and the presence of a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas or duodenum are diagnostic.&nbsp;The duodenum, stomach and/or jejunum are typically affected.&nbsp;One percent of patients with peptic ulcer disease present with ZES. In ZES, parietal cell mass is increased, which leads to further impairment of mucosal defenses. As a result of gastric hypersecretion and inactive pancreatic enzymes, diarrhea and malabsorption in patients with gastrinomas is common.&nbsp;Other symptoms include abdominal pain and heartburn.</p>
